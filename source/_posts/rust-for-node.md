With the advent of [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) ([home](https://webassembly.org/)) there has never been a better time to learn Rust on top of your existing JavaScript and Node.js knowledge for high performance computing in the browser, on the server and on the edge.

Adding Rust to your tech stack on top of Node.js is a match made in heaven as Rust provides advanced support for WebAssembly and WebAssembly binary format is runnable in Node.js.

With this deep dive, you will get up and running using Rust. By the end of this article, you will be familiar enough with Rust to start your own projects and build more complex software!

Notes: as a Node.js developer with mainly JavaScript experience, you will see unfamiliar notations like 'std::wx::yz' or '&xyz', do not worry I explain everything.

Rust is a lower-level language compared to JavaScript and Node.js. This means you are going to get familiar with how computer programs work with the hardware to really understand what's going on. Node.js being much higher-level, you usually don't deal with these notions.

Remember, Rust is initially a systems programming language so closer to the metal/hardware, meaning that the abstractions provided by the language are closer to the actual physical components of the machine. This gives you greater power for high performance programming but also implies more complexity than when programming with JavaScript.

Rust will not hide details like is the value of a variable stored on the stack or the heap, and based on that what is allowed or not. But like with Node.js, there are plenty of libraries/modules to make your life simple.

The problem with many tutorials is that they are made by people who are well versed in compiled languages like C and C++ on Linux. They assume you already know how computers work internally (memory allocation, etc.) which is not the case for many Web developers (even experts in their field).

In this article, I keep it simple and take the point of view of someone who mainly knows JavaScript and Node.js.

Rust is a tough language at first so take your time, relax and come back for more .

**Overall, learning Rust will make you a better Node.js / JavaScript developer!**

## Creating a project in Rust

You can run all the code in this article online (except local stuff like file access, of course) with the [Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2018).

After installing Rust, create a new project with Cargo (the Rust package manager):

```rust
cargo new <PROJECT_NAME>
```

This will create a new folder in your current directory.

Alternatively, to make your current directory the project folder:

```rust
cargo init
```

The source is located in the src/ folder. Of course, the entry point is the `main.rs` file with its main function (**fn** keyword).

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Printing

In Rust, you use what is called a [macro](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)>) to print to the console. Macros in Rust have an identifier followed by an exclamation mark (!). The println! macro is very flexible:

```rust
fn main() {
   // string interpolation
   println!("Adding {} and {} gives {}", 22, 33, 22 + 33);
   // positional arguments
   println!(
        "Your name is {0}. Welcome to {1}. Nice to meet you {0}",
        "Goto", "Rust"
   );
   // named arguments
   println!(
        "{language} is very popular. It was created in {year}",
        language = "Rust",
        year = 2010
   );
  // placeholder traits (using positional argument to avoid repeat)
  println!("{0}, in binary: {0:b}, in hexadecimal: {0:x}", 11);
  // debug trait (very useful to print anything)
  // if you try to print the array directly, you will get an error
  // because an array is not a string or number type
  println!("{:?}", [11, 22, 33]);
}
```

To see the output, run:

```rust
cargo run
```

you will see (along info about compilation of the code — Rust is a compiled language):

```rust
Adding 22 and 33 gives 55
Your name is Goto. Welcome to Rust. Nice to meet you Goto
Rust is very popular. It was created in 2010
Decimal: 11      Binary: 1011    Hexadecimal: b
[11, 22, 33]
```

In Rust, you must use semicolons `;` at the end of a line unless it is the last line of a function that returns something (more on that later).

## Advanced numeric formatted print

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 246.92385;
    let y = 24.69;
    let z = x / y;

    // print line macro with 3 decimal point precision
    println!("z is {:.3}", z);

    // 9: total character space the number to occupy
    // (adds pre padding if necessary)
    println!("z is {:9.3}", z);

    // 0: placeholder number for padding characters
    println!("z is {:09.3}", z);
    println!("z is {:09.3}\nx is {}", z, x);

    // print macro without new line
    print!("y is {:09.3}\nx is {}\n", y, x);

    // positional parameters
    println!("z is {0:05.1} and x is {1:.2}. \nx is also {1}", z, x)
}
```

Output

```rust
z is 10.001
z is    10.001
z is 00010.001
z is 00010.001
x is 246.92385
y is 00024.690
x is 246.92385
z is 010.0 and x is 246.92.
x is also 246.92385
```

## Variables

```rust
fn main() {
    // variables are immutable by default
    // stored on the heap (more on that later)
    let pc = "Inspirion XYZ";
    println!("pc is {}", pc);

    // mutable variables
    let mut age = 1;
    println!("age is {}", age);
    age = 2;
    println!("age is {}", age);

    // constants (must be uppercase and explicit type definition)
    const BRAND: &str = "Dell";
    println!("brand is {}", BRAND);

    // multiple assignment (tuple destructuring)
    // more on tuples later in the article
    let (status, code) = ("OK", 200);
    println!("status: {}, code: {}", status, code);
}
```

Output

```rust
pc is Inspirion XYZ
age is 1
age is 2
brand is Dell
status: OK, code: 200
```

## Basic Types

```rust
fn main() {
    // default integer numeric type is i32
    let num1 = 123;
    println!("{} - type: {}", num1, get_type(&num1));

    // default floating point numeric type is f64
    let num2 = 1.23;
    println!("{} - type: {}", num2, get_type(&num2));

    // explicit typing
    let num3: i8 = 23;
    println!("{} - type: {}", num3, get_type(&num3));

    // max values
    // std is the standard library/crate,
    // it gives access to a rich variety of features,
    // here we use the type modules (i32, i16, etc.) and properties
    let max_i32 = i32::MAX;
    let max_i16 = i16::MAX;
    println!("max value for i32 is {}", max_i32);
    println!("max value for i16 is {}", max_i16);

    // boolean
    let is_rust_fun: bool = true;
    println!(
        "is_rust_fun is {} - type: {}",
        is_rust_fun,
        get_type(&is_rust_fun)
    );
    let is_greater = 23 > 5;
    println!(
        "is_greater is {} - type: {}",
        is_greater,
        get_type(&is_greater)
    );

    // characters (unicode - up to 4 bytes length)
    let smiley = '😈';
    println!("smiley is {} - type: {}", smiley, get_type(&smiley));
}
// helper function to print types
fn get_type<T>(_: &T) -> &str {
    std::any::type_name::<T>()
}
```

Output

```rust
123 - type: i32
1.23 - type: f64
23 - type: i8
max value for i32 is 2147483647
max value for i16 is 32767
is_rust_fun is true - type: bool
is_greater is true - type: bool
smiley is 😈 - type: char
```

## Floating point numbers

-   **f32** (32-bit length floating point number)
-   **f64** (64-bit length floating point number)

```rust
fn main() {
    // by default fractional values stored in f64
    let my_float = 12.345677890123456789012345;
    println!("my_float is: {}", my_float);
    let a_float: f32 = 9.9438535983578493758;
    println!("a_float is: {}", a_float);
    let min_f32 = f32::MIN;
    println!("min_f32 is: {}\n", min_f32);
    let max_f32 = f32::MAX;
    println!("max_f32 is: {}\n", max_f32);
    let min_f64 = f64::MIN;
    println!("min_f64 is: {}\n", min_f64);
    let max_f64 = f64::MAX;
    println!("max_f64 is: {}\n", max_f64);
}
```

Output

```rust
my_float is: 12.345677890123456
a_float is: 9.943853
min_f32 is: -340282350000000000000000000000000000000

max_f32 is: 340282350000000000000000000000000000000

min_f64 is: -179769313486231570000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

max_f64 is: 179769313486231570000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

## Bitwise operations (advanced — can be skipped)

```rust
/*
Bitwise operations: on individual bits rather than sets of bytes.
- binary representation, a sequence of bytes
- underscore separator allowed for legibility
- by default binary representations are store as i32
*/
fn main() {
    // stored as u8 by adding suffix u8

    let mut value = 0b1111_0101u8;
    // will print base 10 (decimal) representation

    println!("value is {}", value);
    /*
    :08b
        0 -> display leading zeros
        8 -> number of bits to display
        b -> display binary representation
    */
    println!("value is {:08b}", value);
    // bitwise NOT: invert individual bits

    value = !value; // 0000_1010
    println!("value is {:08b}", value);
    // bitwise AND: used to clear the value of a specific bit
    value = value & 0b1111_0111; // -> 0000_0010
    println!("value is {:08b}", value);
    // bitwise AND: used to check value of a specific bit
    // if a specific bit is 0 or 1, useful to check status of registers for process state

    println!("value is {:08b}", value & 0b0100_0000);
    // -> 0000_0000
    // bitwise OR: if either operand is 1, result is 1
    // useful to set value of a specific bit

    value = value | 0b0100_0000; // -> 0100_0010
    println!("value is {:08b}", value);
   // bitwise XOR (exclusive OR):
   // result is 1 only when bits are different, otherwise 0
   // useful to set if bits are different

   value = value ^ 0b0101_0101; // -> 0001_0111
   println!("value is {:08b}", value);
   ////////////////////////////
   // Bit Shift operators
   ////////////////////////////
   // shift bit pattern left or right by a number of bits
   // and backfill shifted bit spaces with zeros
   // shift left by 4 bits

   value = value << 4; // -> 0111_0000
   println!("value is {:08b}", value);
   // shift right by 3 bits

   value = value >> 3; // -> 0000_1110
   println!("value is {:08b}", value);
}
```

Output

```rust
value is 245
value is 11110101
value is 00001010
value is 00000010
value is 00000000
value is 01000010
value is 00010111
value is 01110000
value is 00001110
```

## Booleans and binary algebra

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = true;
    let b = false;
    println!("a is {}\nb is {}", a, b);
    println!("NOT a is {}", !a);
    println!("a AND b is {}", a & b);
    println!("a OR b is {}", a | b);
    println!("a XOR b is {}", a ^ b);
    // boolean casted to integer begets 0 or 1
    println!("a XOR b is {}", (a ^ b) as i32); // 1
   let c = (a ^ b) | (a & b);
    println!("c is {}", c);
    // short-circuiting logical operations:
    // right operand not evaluated
    let d = true || (a & b);
    println!("d is {}", d);
    // the panic macro is not evaluated,
    // so the process ends with status 0 (OK, no error)
    // panics exit the program immediately (like throwing error in Node.js)
    let e = false && panic!();
    println!("e is {}", e);
}
```

Output

```rust
a is true
b is false
NOT a is false
a AND b is false
a OR b is true
a XOR b is true
a XOR b is 1
c is true
d is true
e is false
```

## Arithmetic operations

```rust
fn main() {
    // can only do arithmetic operations on same type operands
    let a = 11;
    let b = 33;
    let c = a + b;
    println!("c is {}", c);
    let d = c - b;
    println!("d is {}", d);
    let e = a * d;
    println!("e is {}", e);
    // type casting (careful with precision loss and type compatibility)
    let f = c as f32 / 4.5;
    println!("f is {}", f);
    // operator precedence control

    let g = 43.5432 % (a as f64 * e as f64);
    println!("g is {}", g);
}
```

Output

```rust
c is 44
d is 11
e is 121
f is 9.777778
g is 43.5432
```

## Comparison operators

```rust
/*
can only compare values of same type
*/
fn main() {
    let a = 11;
    let b = 88;
    println!("a is {}\nb is {}", a, b);
    println!("a EQUAL TO b is {}", a == b);
    println!("a NOT EQUAL TO b is {}", a != b);
    println!("a GREATER THAN b is {}", a > b);
    println!("a GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO b is {}", a >= b);
    println!("a LESS THAN b is {}", a < b);
    println!("a LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO b is {}", a <= b);
    let c = true;
    let d = false;
    println!("\nc is {}\nd is {}", c, d);
    println!("c EQUAL TO d is {}", c == d);
    println!("c NOT EQUAL TO d is {}", c != d);
    println!("c GREATER THAN d is {}", c > d);
    println!("c GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO d is {}", c >= d);
    println!("c LESS THAN d is {}", c < d);
    println!("c LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO d is {}", c <= d);
}
```

Output

```rust
a is 11
b is 88
a EQUAL TO b is false
a NOT EQUAL TO b is true
a GREATER THAN b is false
a GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO b is false
a LESS THAN b is true
a LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO b is true
c is true
d is false
c EQUAL TO d is false
c NOT EQUAL TO d is true
c GREATER THAN d is true
c GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO d is true
c LESS THAN d is false
c LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO d is false
```

## Chars

```rust
fn main() {
    // Unicode scalar value stored using 4 bytes (32 bits)
    // contrary to C like languages that store it in 1 byte
    let letter: char = 'z';
    let number_char = '9';
    let finger = '\u{261D}';
    println!("letter is {}", letter);
    println!("number_char is {}", number_char);
    println!("finger is {}", finger);
    println!(
        "{} {}",
        std::mem::size_of_val(&letter),
        std::mem::size_of_val(&finger)
    )
}
```

Output

```rust
letter is z
number_char is 9
finger is ☝
4 4
```

## Computing average

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 33;
    let b = 4.9;
    let c: f32 = 123.5;
    let average = (a as f32 + b as f32 + c) / 3.0;
    println!("average is {}", average);
    assert_eq!(average, 53.8);
    println!("test passed.");
}
```

Output

```rust
average is 53.8
test passed.
```

## Arrays

```rust
fn main() {
    // fixed length and single typed
    // stored in contiguous memory locations
    // Contiguous means that elements are laid out so that every element is the same distance from its neighbors.
    let letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']; // type: [char; 3]
    let first_letter = letters[0];
    println!("first_letter is {}", first_letter);
    // to modify elements in array, it must be mutable
    let mut numbers = [11, 22, 44]; // type is [i32; 3]
    numbers[2] = 33;
    println!("numbers is {}", numbers[2]);
    // empty array declaration (memory allocated)
    let words: [&str; 2];
    words = ["ok"; 2]; // repeat expression, equivalent to ["ok", "ok"]
    println!("words is {:?}", words);
    /*
    length of usize is based on number of bytes needed to reference memory in your target architecture:
    - for 32 bit compilation target -> usize is 4 bytes
    - for 64 bit compilation target -> usize is 8 bytes
    */
    let ints = [22; 5];
    let length: usize = ints.len();
    println!("length is {}", length);
    // get size in memory (mem module of the std crate)
    let mem_size_byte = std::mem::size_of_val(&ints);
    println!("mem_size_byte is {}", mem_size_byte);
    // get slice from array
    let mut slice: &[i32] = &ints;
    println!("slice is {:?}", slice);

    slice = &ints[3..5];
    println!("slice is {:?}", slice);
}
```

Output

```rust
first_letter is a
numbers is 33
words is ["ok", "ok"]
length is 5
mem_size_byte is 20
slice is [22, 22, 22, 22, 22]
slice is [22, 22]
```

## Slices

```rust
fn main() {
    // slice: used to reference a contiguous section (subset) of a collection (array, etc.) WITHOUT taking ownership of these elements
    // commonly used: string slice dt type : &str
    // string literals are slices
    // the data is hard-coded in the executable binary and the program uses a string slice to access it
    // create a string slice from string data
    // the sentence variable has a pointer to the beginning of the string data in memory as well as info about its length and capacity
    let sentence = String::from("This is a sequence of words.");
    println!("sentence is {}", sentence);
    // the last_word variable has a pointer to the offset/start index of the section of the string data, as well as the length of the slice
    // as usual, the end index of the slice is excluded from the result (common in most programming languages when slicing collections)
    let last_word = &sentence[22..22 + 5];          // [start..end_excluded]
    println!("last_word is \"{}\"", last_word);
    // slice from offset index to end of the collection (here string data)
    let last_part: &str = &sentence[22..];
    println!("last_part is \"{}\"", last_part);
    // slice from beginning of collection up until end index
    let without_last_word = &sentence[..22];
    println!("without_last_word is \"{}\"", without_last_word);
    // the length of a string slice is in number of bytes (usize data type)
    // NOT in number of characters
    let slice_length: usize = last_part.len();
    println!("slice_length is {} bytes", slice_length);
    // when creating a string slice, the range indices must occur at valid UTF-8 character boundaries
    // remember that UTF-8 characters can occupy multiple bytes
    // all this to say that slice range indices must be character boundaries
    // if you index in the middle of a character, the program will panic
    // so be careful when creating string slices from strings with special characters or emojis
    // yes, this is some low-level stuff that we usually don't deal with in everyday Node.js
}
```

Output

```rust
sentence is This is a sequence of words.
last_word is "words"
last_part is "words."
without_last_word is "This is a sequence of "
slice_length is 6 bytes
```

## Slices as parameters

```rust
fn main() {
    let message = String::from("lorem ipsum");
    let first_word = get_first_word(&message);
    println!("first_word is \"{}\"", first_word);
    let first_word_too = get_first_word_too(&message[6..]);
    println!("first_word_too is \"{}\"", first_word_too);
}
// ======= passing the entire string as input ===========
fn get_first_word(msg: &String) -> &str {
    // create a slice of bytes (&[u8] data type) from string data
    let bytes: &[u8] = msg.as_bytes();
    // iterate through byte sequence one byte at a time
    // use enumerate() to get the index when iterating
   for (index, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        // find first space and return everything before as a string slice
        // b' ' is the byte representation of a blank space
        // remember that we are iterating on a sequence of bytes, NOT characters
        // we do that because the index for a string slice is in terms of bytes
       if item == b' ' {
            return &msg[..index];
       }
    }
    // no blank space found, return entire message
    &msg
}
// ======= passing a string slice as input ===========
fn get_first_word_too(msg: &str) -> &str {
    let bytes: &[u8] = msg.as_bytes();
    for (index, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &msg[..index];
        }
    }
    &msg
}
```

Output

```rust
first_word is "lorem"
first_word_too is "ipsum"
```

## Deref coercion

Notes:

-   passing a borrowed reference to a string (&String) is **not** the same as passing a string slice (&str)
-   a borrowed string reference points to a string on the stack which in turn owns and points to the data on the heap
-   a slice only stores a pointer to the heap data along with length information. It does not keep track of the capacity because it does **not** own anything on the heap.
-   since a string reference contains all the info to function as a slice (pointer to heap data + length), Rust allows to use a string reference where a string slice is expected
-   this convenience is called **deref coercion**:

```rust
fn main() {
    let message = String::from("lorem ipsum");

    // notice that a string reference is passed as argument
    let first_word = get_first_word(&message);
    println!("first_word is \"{}\"", first_word);
}
// notice that the expected argument is of type string slice (&str)
fn get_first_word(msg: &str) -> &str {
    let bytes: &[u8] = msg.as_bytes();
    for (index, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &msg[..index];
        }
    }
    &msg
}
```

-   of course, deref coercion does not work when using a string slice where a string reference is expected (because of the missing properties)
-   when writing code, prefer using string slices in cases where ownership of the data is not required

## Multidimensional arrays

```rust
fn main() {
    let d2: [[i32; 3]; 3] = [[9, 8, 7], [6, 5, 4], [3, 2, 1]];
    let value = d2[1][0];
    println!("value is {}", value);

    let d3: [[[&str; 100]; 20]; 5];
    d3 = [[["ok"; 100]; 20]; 5];
    println!("value d3[3][11][35] is {}", d3[3][11][35])
}
```

Output

```rust
value is 6
value d3[3][11][35] is ok
```

## Vectors

```rust
fn main() {
    // collection of elements with the same data type
    // elements are sorted in order
    // arrays have a fixed size that must be known at compile time
    // because array data is stored on the stack
    // vectors can dynamically grow and shrink
    // by adding / removing items
    // vector data is stored in heap memory
    // therefore you need to handle ownership and borrowing
    // vectors = mutable size arrays
    let mut letters: Vec<char> = vec!['a', 'b', 'c'];
    println!("letters are {:?}", letters);
    let first_letter = letters[0];
    println!("first_letter is {}", first_letter);
    // add value to vector
    letters.push('d');
    letters.push('e');
    letters.push('f');
    println!("letters are {:?}", letters);
    // remove last value
    letters.pop();
    println!("letters are {:?}", letters);
    let mut numbers: Vec<i32> = vec![11, 22, 44];
    numbers[2] = 33;
    println!("numbers is {}", numbers[2]);
    let words: Vec<&str>;
    words = vec!["ok"; 2];
    println!("words are {:?}", words);
    let mut ints = vec![22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77];
    let length: usize = ints.len();
    println!("length is {}", length);
    let mem_size_byte = std::mem::size_of_val(&ints);
    println!("mem_size_byte is {}", mem_size_byte);
    // slice from vector
    let mut slice: &[i32] = &ints;
    println!("slice is {:?}", slice);
    slice = &ints[2..5];
    println!("slice is {:?}", slice);
    // iterate over vector
    for it in ints.iter() {
        println!("it is {}", it);
    }
    // mutate vector items while iterating
    for it in ints.iter_mut() {
        // dereference the pointer to get and set value (*it)
        *it *= *it;
    }
    println!("ints is {:?}", ints);
}
```

Output

```rust
letters are ['a', 'b', 'c']
first_letter is a
letters are ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
letters are ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
numbers is 33
words is ["ok", "ok"]
length is 6
mem_size_byte is 24
slice is [22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77]
slice is [44, 55, 66]
it is 22
it is 33
it is 44
it is 55
it is 66
it is 77
ints is [484, 1089, 1936, 3025, 4356, 5929]
```

## Tuples

```rust
fn main() {
    // used to group related items of mixed data types
    // can have max 12 mixed type values
    // adding more values and it will no longer be a tuple type
    let a_tuple: (&str, u8, char) = ("ok", 0, 'd');
    let first_item = a_tuple.0;
    println!("first_item is {}", first_item);
    // mutate a tuple
    let mut b_tuple = ("ok", 0);
    b_tuple.0 = "ko";
    b_tuple.1 += 1;
    println!("b_tuple.1 is {}", b_tuple.1);
    // destructure a tuple
    let c_tuple = ("en", "US", 1);
    let (language, country, code) = c_tuple;
    println!(
        "language is: {}\ncountry is: {}\ncode is: {}",
        language, country, code
    )
}
```

Output

```rust
first_item is ok
b_tuple.1 is 1
language is: en
country is: US
code is: 1
```

## Functions

```rust
fn main() {
    be_polite();
    // inferred types for y and z are the ones used as parameters of add()
    // to be clear, if you do not declare a specific type for variables, these variables will assume the type of the arguments of the function where first used
   // remember, by the default inferred type is i32 for integers
    let y = 12;
    let z = 34;
    // now y and z are considered u8 type because this is how they are first used as function arguments
    add(y, z);
    // passing later y and z to another fn with different param types will panic
    // guess_number(z) // -> expects a i32 not a u8
    // need for explicit cast:
    guess_number(y as i32)
}
fn be_polite() {
    println!("Greetings, pleased to meet you.");
    guess_number(25)
}
fn guess_number(number: i32) {
    println!("Indeed, {} is the correct answer", number)
}
fn add(a: u8, b: u8) {
    let sum = a + b;
    println!("sum is {}", sum)
}
```

Output

```rust
Greetings, pleased to meet you.
Indeed, 25 is the correct answer
sum is 46
Indeed, 12 is the correct answer
```

## Statements and expressions

```rust
fn main() {
    // Statement performs an action without returning a value
    // statements end with a semicolon: a = 6;
    // an expression evaluates to a resulting value
    // expressions do NOT end with a semicolon: 3 + 4 which evaluates to 7
    // adding a semicolon to an expressions transforms it into an statement
    // expressions are used as parts of statements: let total = r + c;\n\t{}\n\t{}",
    // where "r + c" is an expression and "let total = r + c;" is a statement
    println!("expression 4 + 5 evaluates to: {}", 4 + 5);
}
```

Output

```rust
expression 4 + 5 evaluates to: 9
```

## Function return type

```rust
fn main() {
    let result = square(3);
    println!("result is {}", result);
    let result_tuple = triple(33);
    let (input, result1) = result_tuple;
    println!("result_tuple is {:?}", result_tuple);
    // {:?} ==> debug formatting
    println!("input {} evaluates to {}", input, result1);
    let nothing: () = does_not_return();
    println!("nothing (union data type) is {:?}", nothing)
}
fn square(number: i32) -> i32 {
    println!("processing square({})", number);
    // expression returning a value
    number * number
    // " return  number * number;" is also valid syntax
}
// multiple returns with tuples
fn triple(number: i32) -> (i32, i32) {
    println!("tripling the number: {}", number);
    let input = number;
    let result = number * 3;
    (input, result)
}
// union data type
// used when no meaningful values returned by a fn
// represented by empty ()
// it is optional
fn does_not_return() -> () {
    println!("ain't returning nuthing!")
}
```

Output

```rust
processing square(3)
result is 9
tripling the number: 33
result_tuple is (33, 99)
input 33 evaluates to 99
ain't returning nuthing!
nothing (union data type) is ()
```

## Closures

```rust
fn main() {
    // closures are anonymous functions that have access to variables in the enclosing scope
    // long form
    let double = |n1: u8| -> u8 { n1 * 2 };
    // short form
    let triple = |n1| n1 * 3;
    const DAYS_IN_YEAR: u16 = 365;
    // referencing variable from enclosing scope
    let quadruple_than_add_number_days_in_year = |n1: i32| n1 * 4 + (DAYS_IN_YEAR as i32);
    const FACTOR: i32 = 22;
    let multiple_by_22 = |x| FACTOR * x;
    println!("{}", double(11));
    println!("{}", triple(99));
    println!("{}", quadruple_than_add_number_days_in_year(44));
    println!("{}", multiple_by_22(5));
}
```

Output

```rust
22
297
541
110
```

## Celsius to Fahrenheit converter

```rust
fn main() {
    let (celsius, farenheit) = to_farenheit(40.0);
    println!("{} celsius is {} farenheit", celsius, farenheit);
    assert_eq!(farenheit, 104.0);
    // will not execute if assertion fails
    println!("test passed");
}
fn to_farenheit(celsius: f32) -> (f32, f32) {
    let farenheit = (1.8 * celsius) + 32.0;
    // return statement (no semicolon)
    (celsius, farenheit)
}
```

## Conditional execution

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    if x == 5 {
        println!("x is 5");
    }
    // if expressions (equivalent of ternary operator in JS/Node.js)
    let x_odd = if x % 2 == 0 { "odd" } else { "even" };
    println!("x_odd is {}", x_odd);
}
```

Output

```rust
x is 5
x_odd is even
```

## Multiple conditionals (if/else if)

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2;
    let y = 5;
    if x > y {
        println!("x is greater than  y");
    } else if x < y {
        println!("x is less than y");
    } else {
        println!("x is equal to y");
    }
}
```

Output

```rust
x is less than y
```

## Loop assignment

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    // infinite loop
    loop {
        if count == 10 {
            break;
        }
        count += 1;
        println!("count is {}", count);
    }
    println!("\nAfter first loop.\n");
    // returning a value from loop expression
    let result = loop {
        if count == 15 {
            // returning a value with break statement
            break count * 20;
        }
        count += 1;
        println!("count is {}", count);
    };
    println!("\nAfter second loop, result is {}", result);
}
```

Output

```rust
count is 1
count is 2
count is 3
count is 4
count is 5
count is 6
count is 7
count is 8
count is 9
count is 10
After first loop.
count is 11
count is 12
count is 13
count is 14
count is 15
After second loop, result is 300
```

## While loops

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    let letters: [char; 5] = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];
    while count < letters.len() {
        println!("letter[{}] is {}", count, letters[count]);
        count += 1;
    }
// contrary to loop expressions, the break statement in while loop cannot return a value
}
```

Output

```rust
letter[0] is a
letter[1] is b
letter[2] is c
letter[3] is d
letter[4] is e
```

## For loops

```rust
fn main() {
    let message = ['m', 'e', 's', 's', 'a', 'g', 'e'];
    /* Iterator
    - implements logic to iterate over each item in a collection
    - next() method returns the next item in a sequence
      */
    for item in message.iter() {
        println!("current item is {}", item);
    }
    println!("");
    // To also get the indexes when iterating
    // enumerate() returns a tuple with index/item_reference pair
    // To get the item use &item
    // because the iterator gives back a reference (&<NAME>)
    // Adding the & (borrow operator) allows you to
    // borrow the variable without
    // taking ownership (see borrowing section)
    // - then when you use the variable in the for loop scope, you access the value
    for (index, &item) in message.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("item {} is {}", index, item);
        if item == 'e' {
            break;
        }
    }
    println!("");
    // iterating over a range of numbers
    // excludes the end value of the range
    for number in 0..5 {
        println!("number is {}", number);
    }
}
```

Output

```rust
current item is m
current item is e
current item is s
current item is s
current item is a
current item is g
current item is e
item 0 is m
item 1 is e
number is 0
number is 1
number is 2
number is 3
number is 4
```

## Nested loops

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]];
    // reading from matrix
    for row in matrix.iter() {
        for number in row.iter() {
            print!("{}\t", number);
        }
        println!("");
    }
    println!("=======================");
    // modifying values from mutable matrix
    // iter_mut() returns mutable references
    for row in matrix.iter_mut() {
        for number in row.iter_mut() {
            // dereference with asterisk to get the value itself
            *number += 20;
            print!("{}\t", number);
        }
        println!("");
    }
}
```

Output

```rust
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
=======================
21 22 23
24 25 26
27 28 29
```

## Guessing game

```rust
use rand::Rng;
use std::io;
fn main() {
    println!("Guess a number");
    println!("Please enter your guess:");
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);
    println!("The secret number is {}", secret_number);
    // "::" is used for associated functions of a given type (equiv to static methods in OOP - more on this later)
    // String::new() creates an empty string of type String    (growable UTF-8 encoded text)
    let mut guess = String::new();
    /*
        std::io::stdin, if you don't use the import at the top of file
        std::io::stdin() returns an instance of a std::io::Stdin type
    */
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");
    println!("You guess: {}", guess);
}
```

## Basic statistics

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = [1, 9, -2, 0, 23, 20, -7, 13, 37, 20, 56, -18, 20, 3];
    let mut max: i32 = numbers[0];
    let mut min: i32 = numbers[0];
    let mut mean: f64 = 0.0;
    for item in numbers.iter() {
        mean += *item as f64;
        if *item > max {
            max = *item;
        }
        if *item < min {
            min = *item;
        }
    }
    mean /= numbers.len() as f64;
    assert_eq!(max, 56);
    assert_eq!(min, -18);
    assert_eq!(mean, 12.5);
    println!("Test passed!");
}
```

Output

```rust
Test passed!
```

## Scope

```rust
fn main() {
    let planet = "Dunya";
    if true {
        let planet = "Jupiter";
        println!("planet is {}", planet);
    }
    println!("planet is {}", planet);
}
```

Output

```rust
planet is Jupiter
planet is Dunya
```

## Variable mutability

```rust
fn main() {
    let car = "Mitsubishi";
    println!("car is a {}", car);
    // code block, has its own scope
    {
        // variable shadowing
        let car = 1;
        println!("car is a {}", car);
    }
    println!("car is a {}", car);
}
```

Output

```rust
car is a Mitsubishi
car is a 1
car is a Mitsubishi
```

## Stack and heap memory

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("=== STACK ====\n");
    println!("- values stored in sequential order of insertion");
    println!("- data added in LIFO (last in first out)");
    println!("- stores variables - pushing values on the stack");
    println!("- also holds info for function execution");
    println!(
        "- stack have very fast access because no guessing where to put data, it will be on top"
    );
    println!("- stacks are limited in size");
    println!("- all data in stack must have a known fixed size\n");
    func1();
    println!("func1 done");
    println!("pop variable y off the stack");
    println!("pop variable z off the stack\n");
println!("\n\n=== HEAP ====\n");
    println!("- adding data to heap, search for large enough place in memory to store data");
    println!("- marks memory spot as being used (allocating) and put data in it");
    println!("- accessing data in heap is more complex than the stack because the stack allocates anywhere in available memory");
    println!("- slower than stack");
    println!("- dynamically add and remove data");
    println!("\n\n=== POINTER ====\n");
    println!("- data type that stores a memory address");
    println!("- pointers have a fixed size so can be stored on the stack");
    println!("- adding and accessing data on the heap is done through pointers (addresses in memory)");
}
fn func1() {
    println!("func1 executing...");
    let y = 3.11;
    println!("push variable y = {} onto the stack", y);
    let z = 5;
    println!("push variable z = {} onto the stack", z);
    func2();
    println!("func2 done");
    println!("pop variable arr off the stack");
}
fn func2() {
    println!("func2 executing...");
    let arr = [2, 3, 4];
    println!("push variable arr = {:?} onto the stack", arr);
}
```

Output

```rust
=== STACK ====
- values stored in sequential order of insertion
- data added in LIFO (last in first out)
- stores variables - pushing values on the stack
- also holds info for function execution
- stack have very fast access because no guessing where to put data, it will be on top
- stacks are limited in size
- all data in stack must have a known fixed size
func1 executing...
push variable y = 3.11 onto the stack
push variable z = 5 onto the stack
func2 executing...
push variable arr = [2, 3, 4] onto the stack
func2 done
pop variable arr off the stack
func1 done
pop variable y off the stack
pop variable z off the stack
=== HEAP ====
- adding data to heap, search for large enough place in memory to store data
- marks memory spot as being used (allocating) and put data in it
- accessing data in heap is more complex than the stack because the stack allocates anywhere in available memory
- slower than stack
- dynamically add and remove data
=== POINTER ====
- data type that stores a memory address
- pointers have a fixed size so can be stored on the stack
- adding and accessing data on the heap is done through pointers (addresses in memory)
```

## Strings

Rust has two kinds of string types.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Two types of string representation:

    // - string literals: hard coded into the executable.
    // these are immutable and must be known before compilation

    // - String type: allocated data on the heap, mutable and dynamically generated at runtime
    // string literal stored on heap
    // String::from() creates a String type from a string literal
    // the sequence [m,a,r,s] will get stored on the heap
    // to access the string stored on heap, program holds a pointer to it on the stack (message variable)
    // that pointer on the stack includes first char memory address, length of string and the capacity so you know how much memory s allocated for it on the heap
    let mut message = String::from("Jupiter");
    println!("message is {}", message);
    // append string to original
    // if more memory need than capacity, pointer address updated as well as length and capacity to reflect new location in memory
    message.push_str(" is smoke and mirrors");
    println!("message is {}", message);
    // pushing a char
    message.push('!');
    println!("message is {}", message);
   // get length
   println!("message lenght is {}", message.len());
   // get capacity in bytes
   println!("message capacity is {}", message.capacity());
  // check if empty
  println!("Is empty: {}", message.is_empty());
  // substring search
  println!("Contains smoke: {}", message.contains("smoke"));
  // replace substring
  println!("message is {}", message.replace("smoke","gaz"));
  // loop over words in string (split by white space)
  for word in message.split_whitespace() {
    println!("word is {}", word);
  }
  // create string with capacity
  let mut s = String::with_capacity(4); // 4 bytes capacity
  println!("s capacity is  {} bytes", s.capacity());
  // 1 byte consumed
  // Latin alphabet letters usually have 1 byte size
  // remember Unicode supports 4-byte characters
  s.push('Q');
  s.push('W'); // 1 byte consumed
  s.push_str("er"); // 2 bytes consumed
  // exceeding string capacity (automagically increased and reallocation in memory)
  s.push('T'); // 1 byte consumed
  println!("s capacity is  now {} bytes", s.capacity());
}
```

Output

```rust
message is Jupiter
message is Jupiter is smoke and mirrors
message is Jupiter is smoke and mirrors!
message lenght is 29
message capacity is 56
Is empty: false
Contains smoke: true
message is Jupiter is gaz and mirrors!
word is Jupiter
word is is
word is smoke
word is and
word is mirrors!
s capacity is  4 bytes
s capacity is  now 8 bytes
```

## Ownership

```rust
fn main() {
    /* need to clean up allocated memory blocks no longer needed
    in C/C++: malloc() and free() for manual memory mngt
    other approach is garbage collection which is automatic */
    /*
    Rust uses OWNERSHIP system:
       - variables are responsible for freeing their own resources
       - every value is owned by only one variable at a time
       - when owning variable goes out of scope the value is dropped
       - there are ways to transfer ownership of a value from one variable to another
    */
    let outer_planet: String;
    let outer_galaxy: String;
    let outer_planet_position: i32;
    // inner code block scope
    {
        let inner_planet = String::from("Mercury");
        println!("inner_planet is {}", inner_planet);
        /*
        because ownership mandates only one owner per value/data,

## Transferring ownership (data stored on STACK)

```rust
fn main() {
    let rocket_fuel = 1;
    process_fuel(rocket_fuel);
    println!("rocket_fuel is {}", rocket_fuel);
}
/*
    - because propellant is i32 so lives on the stack,
    the value passed as argument is COPIED in fn scope
    - to be able to modify the copy inside the function scope, use the mut keyword
*/
fn process_fuel(mut propellant: i32) {
    // the copy is modified
    propellant += 2;
    println!("Processing propellant {}", propellant);
}
```

Output

```rust
Processing propellant 3
rocket_fuel is 1
```

## Transferring ownership (data stored on HEAP)

```rust
fn main() {
    let rocket_fuel = String::from("MU-RF");
    process_fuel(rocket_fuel);
    // the ownership of the string has moved to propellant variable,

    // the following code will panic because rocket_fuel ownership is done so you can no longuer use the variable
    // println!("rocket_fuel is {}", rocket_fuel);
}
/*
    - because propellant is String so lives on the HEAP
    - data stored on heap when passed as argument to function,
    - the function local variable gets a pointer to the data passed
    - and therefore the local function variable gets ownership of the data.
*/
fn process_fuel(propellant: String) {
    // propellant takes ownership of the String data stored on the heap
    println!("Processing propellant {}", propellant);
}
```

Output

```rust
Processing propellant MU-RF
```

> **Note:** A thing to remember as a Node.js developer is that variables associated to mutable-length data (aka stored on the heap) do **NOT** contain the data itself but a **pointer to that data** in memory. The pointer is a reference to the data but **NOT** the data itself either, it describes the data and how it can be retrieved.

To keep the ownership of the string by the rocket_fuel variable, you can clone the data:

```rust
fn main() {
    let rocket_fuel = String::from("MU-RF");
    // ownership of the string his kept by rocket_fuel variable,
    // a clone/copy of the string data is passed as argument
    process_fuel( rocket_fuel.clone() );

    // no panic because rocket_fuel stills own the string data
    println!("rocket_fuel is {}", rocket_fuel);
}
fn process_fuel(propellant: String) {
    // propellant takes ownership of the String data clone
    // mutations on the clone of course will not affect the original data (but remember that you will need to declare mut in function signature)
    println!("Processing propellant {}", propellant);
}
```

Ouput

```rust
Processing propellant MU-RF
rocket_fuel is MU-RF
```

If you do not want to copy the data and need the original variable to keep ownership of the data, then you can pass ownership back when the function is done:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut rocket_fuel = String::from("MU-RF");
    // of course, you can declare again without mut
    rocket_fuel = process_fuel(rocket_fuel);
    println!("rocket_fuel is {}", rocket_fuel);
}
// notice the mut on the parameter declaration, to be able to mutate the data passed inside the function scope
// notice the String return type and the last line without a semicolon
fn process_fuel(mut propellant: String) -> String {
    println!("Processing propellant {}", propellant);

    propellant.push_str("-super");

    propellant
}
```

Ouput

```rust
Processing propellant MU-RF
rocket_fuel is MU-RF-super
```

## Borrowing

All this stuff about ownership is great but what if you don't need to transfer ownership, you just need the data:

```rust
fn main() {
    // BORROWING: access data without taking ownership
    // create a reference to the variable you want to borrow
    // using borrow operator "&"
    let rocket_fuel = String::from("MU-RF");
    // notice the borrow operator to create a reference
    // the function expects a reference, not a value
    let length = process_fuel(&rocket_fuel);
    println!("rocket_fuel is {}, length: {}", rocket_fuel,length);
}
// notice the borrow operator in parameter type
// we expect propellant to be a reference to a string,
// not a string value (/pointer to it...)
fn process_fuel(propellant: &String) -> usize {
    // propellant is a reference to the variable that points to the string data, to borrow the data
    // again, NO SHALLOW COPY here because propellant borrows the pointer, it does contain the pointer itself (let's say that it's a pointer to another pointer...)
    println!("Processing propellant {}", propellant);
    let length = propellant.len();
    length
    // when the propellant variable goes out of scope at the end of the function,
    // the string data is still on the heap because it remains owned by the original variable (rocket_fuel)
 }
```

Output

```rust
Processing propellant MU-RF
rocket_fuel is MU-RF, lenght: 5
```

In Rust, data will most often be passed by **reference** (borrowed)than by value (ownership transfer). But you still need to know which variable really owns the data.

## Mutating borrowed data

```rust
fn main() {
    // notice it is a mutable variable
    let mut rocket_fuel = String::from("MU-RF");
    // notice we pass a mutable reference (&mut <TYPE>)
    let length = process_fuel(&mut rocket_fuel);
    println!("rocket_fuel is {}, length: {}", rocket_fuel, length);
}
// notice the &mut in the parameter list
// we expect propellant to be a mutable reference to a String
fn process_fuel(propellant: &mut String) -> usize {
    println!("Processing propellant {}", propellant);
    // mutating borrowed data
    propellant.push_str("333");
    let length = propellant.len();
    length
}
```

Output

```rust
Processing propellant MU-RF
rocket_fuel is MU-RF333, lenght: 8
```

## Restriction on borrowed data

Once you create a mutable reference to a variable, you cannot create other references to it **within that same scope**.

This prevents **data races** which occur when multiple references can access and mutate the same data.

Data races are a common problem when writing programs handling multiple threads that execute concurrently (no matter the programming language — even JavaScript with Node.js [ which is supposed to be single threaded…but advanced use cases allow for multiprocessing and multi-threading…know your tools! ]).

This restriction allows Rust to prevent data races at **compile time.**

To sum up (notice the curly braces denoting different scopes):

```rust
fn main() {
    // IMMUTABLE references = as many as you want per scope
    {
        let something = String::from("a thing");
        let one_ref = &something;
        let another_ref = &something;
        let some_ither_ref = &something;
        println!("{:?}", (one_ref, another_ref, some_ither_ref));
    }
    // MUTABLE references = ONE per scope
    {
        let mut something_changing = String::from("another thing");
        let the_one_and_only_ref = &mut something_changing;
        // CANNOT create other references to "something_changing"
        // NO MATTER if mutable or immutable
        // the following will make the program panic
        // let trying_ref = &something_changing;
        // let trying_other_ref = &mut something_changing;
        println!("It's only {}", the_one_and_only_ref);
    }
}
```

Output

```rust
("a thing", "a thing", "a thing")
It's only another thing
```

## Dangling references

```rust
fn main() {
    let everything = create_something();
    // "everything" is a stale reference pointing to nothing
    // the program will not compile
    println!("everything is {}", everything);
}
// notice the return type
fn create_something() -> &String {
    let new_thing = String::from("new in town");
    // this is a dangling reference because:
    // new_thing goes out of scope at the end of the function
    // returning a reference to that variable does not make sense
    // because the data will have been dropped from memory because not owned anymore by a variable
    &new_thing
}
```

program will not compile because of dangling reference. The solution is to the created string instead of a reference to it:

```rust
fn main() {
    let everything = create_something();
    println!("everything is {}", everything);
}
fn create_something() -> String {
    let new_thing = String::from("new in town");
    new_thing
}
```

Output

```rust
everything is new in town
```

## Structs (a.k.a structures)

-   used to group multiple related items of mixed data types
-   elements are named (unlike tuples where they are ordered)
-   two kinds of structs (regular struct and tuple struct)

```rust
// tuple struct
// used to store a collection of mixed data without named fields
// used to be distinguished as a specific type
// (not just a regular tuple)
struct Signal(u8, bool, String);

// regular struct
// struct names are capitalized
// like classes in JavaScript and OOP generally
struct Car {
    // fields of the struct
    model: String,
    year: String,
    used: bool,
}
// method: functions/subroutines associated to a struct
// methods are defined within the context of a struct
// the first parameter of a method is the reference to a struct instance
impl Car {
    // construct car
    fn new(m: &str, y: &str) -> Car {
        Car {
            model: m.to_string(),
            year: y.to_string(),
            used: false,
        }
    }
    // self is equivalent to "this" is JavaScript
    fn serialize(&self) -> String {
        format!(
            "model: {} - year: {} - used: {}",
            self.model, self.year, self.used
        )
    }
    // mutate state
    fn marked_used(&mut self) {
        self.used = true;
    }
}
struct Position {
  latitude: f64,
  longitude: f64
}
fn print_signal(s: &Signal) {
    println!("s1 is {}, {}, {}", s.0, s.1, s.2);
}
fn main() {
    let mut pos_1 = Position {
        latitude: 27.299112,
        longitude: 95.387110,
    };
    println!(
      "pos_1 is {:.3}, {:.3}",
      pos_1.latitude,
      pos_1.longitude
    );
    pos_1.latitude = 23.1111;
    println!(
      "pos_1 is now {:.3}, {:.3}",
      pos_1.latitude,
      pos_1.longitude
    );
    let mut s1 = Signal(0, true, String::from("ok"));
    // fields of a tuple struct are accessed like regular tuples values
    // using their index
    // remember tuple structs do not have named fields
    print_signal(&s1);
    s1.0 = 23;
    s1.1 = false;
    s1.2 = String::from("NETERR");
    println!("s1 is now {}, {}, {}", s1.0, s1.1, s1.2);
    let car_1 = Car::new("QBC", "2133");
    println!("car_1 is a {} of {}", car_1.model, car_1.year);
    let is_used = if car_1.used == true {
        "used"
    } else {
        "brand new"
    };
    println!("car_1 is {}", is_used);
    println!("car_1 is {}", car_1.serialize());
    let mut car_2 = Car::new("ZZ7", "2042");
    println!("car_2 is a {}", car_2.serialize());
    car_2.marked_used();
    println!("car_2 is now {}", car_2.serialize());
}
```

Output

```rust
pos_1 is 27.299, 95.387
pos_1 is now 23.111, 95.387
s1 is 0, true, ok
s1 is now 23, false, NETERR
car_1 is a QBC of 2133
car_1 is brand new
car_1 is model: QBC - year: 2133 - used: false
car_2 is a model: ZZ7 - year: 2042 - used: false
car_2 is now model: ZZ7 - year: 2042 - used: true
```

## Enums

```rust
// defines a data type with multiple possible variants
enum Controller {
    Turbo,
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
    X,
    Y,
    A,
    B,
}
fn push_button_notify(c: &Controller) {
    // pattern matching (equivalent to switch in JavaScript)
    match c {

        Controller::Down => println!("Down button pushed."),
        Controller::Left => println!("Left button pushed."),
        Controller::Right => println!("Right button pushed."),
        Controller::Y => println!("Y button pushed."),
        Controller::X => println!("X button pushed."),

Output

```rust

## Trimming strings

```rust
fn main() {
    let test1 = "This is test1.        ";
    assert_eq!(trim_space(&test1), "This is test1.");
    let test2 = "        This is test2.";
    assert_eq!(trim_space(&test2), "This is test2.");
    let test3 = "        This is test3.               ";
    assert_eq!(trim_space(&test3), "This is test3.");
    let test4 = "This is test4.";
    assert_eq!(trim_space(&test4), "This is test4.");
    let test5 = "        ";
    assert_eq!(trim_space(&test5), "");
    let test6 = "";
    assert_eq!(trim_space(&test6), "");
    let test7 = "    😸   ";
    assert_eq!(trim_space(&test7), "😸");
    let test8 = "     😸😸 test8.   ";
    assert_eq!(trim_space(&test8), "😸😸 test8.");
    let test9 = "     😸😸 test9. 😸😸   ";
    assert_eq!(trim_space(&test9), "😸😸 test9. 😸😸");
    // note: strings in Rust have a trim() method
    let test10 = " 😸This is the last test😸.😸      ";
    let trimmed_message = test10.trim();
    assert_eq!(trimmed_message, "😸This is the last test😸.😸");
}
fn trim_space(s: &str) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    let mut result = "";
    // trim leading spaces by finding first non-space character
    // iterate over byte representation of the string slice
    // we do this because, we use am intermediary string slice
    for (index, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item != b' ' {
            result = &s[index..];
            break;
        }
    }
    let bytes = result.as_bytes();
    // trim trailing spaces by finding last non-pace character
    for t in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        let index = t.0;
        let reverse_index = result.len() - index;
        if bytes[reverse_index - 1] != b' ' {
            result = &result[..reverse_index];
            break;
        }
    }
    result
}
```

Other possible solution:

```rust
fn trim_space(s: &str) -> &str {
    let mut start = 0;
    let mut end = 0;
    // iterate over the characters of the string slice
    for (index, character) in s.chars().enumerate() {
        if character != ' ' {
            start = index;
            break;
        }
    }
    for (index, character) in s.chars().rev().enumerate() {
        if character != ' ' {
            end = s.len() - index;
            break;
        }
    }
    &s[start..end]
}

```

## Standard library

-   documentation: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/

```rust
// the use statement is used to import crates/libraries
// it brings a module path into the scope of a program
// some modules of the standard library are not part of the Rust language itself
// (meaning, you need to import them - like the "fs" module in Node.js - otherwise the compiler will not know what they mean)
// the standard library is available to all programs by default
// the prelude is a list of things that are automatically imported into every Rust program
// it does not import the entire std library (only the most common standard modules)
// if a module is not included into the prelude, you need to manually import it
use std::thread;
fn main() {
    let child = thread::spawn(move || 2 + 2);
    let res = child.join();
    println!("res is {}", res.unwrap());
}
```

Output

```rust
res is 4
```

## Parsing standard input

```rust
// read command line inputs
use std::io;
fn main() {
  let mut buffer = String::new();
  println!("Enter your name:");
  // ===== access the stdin stream =====
  // the read_line() function will update the buffer with the input string
  // read_line() blocks the execution of the program until something is entered at the command line
  let read_line_result = io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer);
  println!("read_line_result is {:?}", read_line_result);
  println!("Welcome to Rust, {}", buffer);
  // ===== parse input string ========
  // clear buffer from previous input
  buffer.clear();
  println!("Enter the year when you started learning Rust:");
  let read_line_result = io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer);
  println!("read_line_result is {:?}", read_line_result);
  // need to trim the input string because contains a newline at the end
  // notice the turbofish operator (::<i32>) to indicate the type of data to parse from the input string (here an i32 integer)
  // parse() returns a Result enum
  // Result enum allow to handle errors (more on this later)
  // use the unwrap function to extract the value
  let start_year = buffer.trim().parse::<i32>().unwrap();
  println!("You started your Rust journey in {}", start_year);
  // without using the turbofish operator, indicate the destination type as the variable type
  let start_year: i32 = buffer.trim().parse().unwrap();
  println!("You will be an expert in {}", start_year + 5);
}
```

Output (> marks command line inputs)

```rust
Enter your name:
> Florian
read_line_result is Ok(8)
Welcome to Rust, Florian
Enter the year when you started learning Rust:
> 2021
read_line_result is Ok(6)
You started your Rust journey in 2021
You will be an expert in 2026
```

## Crates

-   collection of source code files
-   crates registry: [crates.io](https://crates.io/)
    (equivalent to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) for Node.js modules)
-   two kinds:
    \- **binary crates** contain the source code to compile to execute the program
    \- **library crates** contain code for other programs to execute
-   to use third-party crates, add the crate name and version in the Cargo.toml file in the **[dependencies]** section (external crates):

```rust
[package]
name = "crates"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Florian GOTO <you@example.com>"]
edition = "2018"
# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html
[dependencies]
# add the random number generation crate
rand = "0.8.3"
```

-   Cargo will automatically download the crates in the **[dependencies]** section along with their own dependencies before compiling
-   to use the downloaded crate

```rust
use rand;
fn main() {
  let random_number = rand::random::<u8>();
  println!("random_number is {}", random_number);
}
```

Output

```rust
random_number is 97
```

-   if you use a specific function of a crate, specify it directly in the use statement (the compiler will warn you about name collisions with locally defined code):

```rust
// import only the random() function of the rand crate
use rand::random;
// import everything from the rand crate prelude
// use rand::prelude::*;
fn main() {
  let random_number = random::<u8>();
  println!("random_number is {}", random_number);
}
// cannot have a local function named random in the same scope
// the program will not compile if the following code is added because of the name collision
// fn random() -> u8 {
//   123
// }
```

## Guessing game revisited

```rust
use rand::prelude::*;
use std::io;
fn main() {
    const MAX_RETRIES: i8 = 3;
    // generate random number between specified range
    let random_number: i8 = thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
    let mut buffer = String::new();
    let mut retry_count = 0;
    println!("Guess a number between 1 and 100:");
    while retry_count < MAX_RETRIES {
       // clear previous guess
       buffer.clear();
       io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut buffer)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
       // expect() is equivalent to unwrap()
       // used to get value from Result enum
       // it allows to print a custom message when an error occurs
       let guess = buffer.trim()
                         .parse::<i8>()
                         .expect("Failed to parse number");
       if guess < random_number {
            retry_count += 1;
            println!(
                "too low. {}",
                if retry_count < MAX_RETRIES {
                    "Try again:"
                } else {
                    ""
                }
            );
        }
        if guess > random_number {
            retry_count += 1;
            println!(
                "too high. {}",
                if retry_count < MAX_RETRIES {
                    "Try again:"
                } else {
                    ""
                }
            );
        }
        if guess == random_number {
            println!("correct!");
            return;
        }
    }
    println!("random_number was {}", random_number);
}
```

Alternative implementation:

```rust
use rand::prelude::*;
use std::io;
fn main() {
    guess_with_infinite_retry();
}
fn guess_with_infinite_retry() {
    let secret_number = thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
    println!("Guess a number between 1 and 100:");
    loop {
        let mut guess = String::new();
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
        let guess: u32 = guess.trim()
                              .parse()
                              .expect("Failed to parse guess");
        if guess < secret_number {
            println!("guess too low, guess higher:");
        } else if guess > secret_number {
            println!("guess too high, guess lower:");
        } else {
            println!("you found it!");
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

Alternative implementation with “continue playing”:

```rust
use rand::prelude::*;
use std::io;
fn main() {
    guess_with_limited_retry(5);
}
fn guess_with_limited_retry(max_retries: i8) {
    // generate random number between specified range
    let random_number: i8 = thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
    let mut buffer = String::new();
    let mut new_game = true;
    while new_game == true {
        println!("Guess a number between 1 and 100:");
        let mut retry_count = 0;
         while retry_count < max_retries {
            buffer.clear();
            io::stdin()
                .read_line(&mut buffer)
                .expect("Failed to read line");
            let guess = buffer.trim()
                              .parse::<i8>()
                              .expect("Failed to parse number");
            if guess < random_number {
                retry_count += 1;
                println!(
                    "too low. {}",
                    if retry_count < max_retries {
                        "Try again:"
                    } else {
                        ""
                    }
                );
            }
            if guess > random_number {
                retry_count += 1;
                println!(
                    "too high. {}",
                    if retry_count < max_retries {
                        "Try again:"
                    } else {
                        ""
                    }
                );
            }
            if guess == random_number {
                println!("correct!");
                break;
            }
        }
      println!("random_number was {}", random_number);
      println!("do you want to continue playing ? (y/n)");
      let mut try_again = String::new();
      io::stdin()
         .read_line(&mut try_again)
         .expect("Failed to read line");
      let try_again: char = try_again
         .trim()
         .parse()
         .expect("Failed to parse try again answer.");
      if try_again == 'y' {
            new_game = true;
      } else if try_again == 'n' {
            new_game = false;
      } else {
            println!("answer with y or n.")
      }
    }
}
```

## Command line arguments

```rust
use std::env;
fn main() {
    // check for required number of arguments
    if env::args().len() <= 2 {
        println!("this program requires at least two arguments");
        return;
    }
    // args() returns an iterator over arguments passed to the program executable binary file
    // use enumerate() to get input args and their index
    // first argument is the executable path (but not always)
    for (index, arg) in env::args().enumerate() {
        println!("argument {} is {}", index, arg);
    }
    // get argument at specific index
    let arg2 = env::args().nth(2).unwrap();
    println!("\narg2 is {}", arg2);
}
```

Output

```rust
> cargo run toto "titi.txt" --flag -t
argument 0 is target/debug/command_line_args
argument 1 is toto
argument 2 is titi.txt
argument 3 is --flag
argument 4 is -t
arg2 is titi.txt
```

## Reading content from file

-   create a fruits.txt file in your project folder with the following content:

```rust
apple
avocado
banana
cherry
orange
mango
coconut
pear
lemon
```

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;
fn main() {
    let path = Path::new("./fruits.txt");
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(path)
                      .expect("Failed to read file.");
    println!("contents is: {}", contents);
    // process individual lines
    for line in contents.lines() {
        println!("line is {}", line);
    }
    // read file as bytes
    let contents: Vec<u8> = fs::read(path)
                               .expect("Failed to read file.");
    println!("\ncontents is: {:?}", contents);
}
```

Output

```rust
contents is: apple
avocado
banana
cherry
orange
mango
coconut
pear
lemon
line is apple
line is avocado
line is banana
line is cherry
line is orange
line is mango
line is coconut
line is pear
line is lemon
contents is: [97, 112, 112, 108, 101, 10, 97, 118, 111, 99, 97, 100, 111, 10, 98, 97, 110, 97, 110, 97, 10, 99, 104, 101, 114, 114, 121, 10, 111, 114, 97, 109, 103, 101, 10, 109, 97, 110, 103, 111, 10, 99, 111, 99, 111, 110, 117, 116, 10, 112, 101, 97, 114, 10, 108, 101, 109, 111, 110, 10]
```

## Writing content to file

-   copy the fruits.txt file from the previous section

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path;
// import the Write trait of the io module prelude (more on traits later)
use std::io::prelude::*;
fn main() {
    let path = path::Path::new("./file.txt");
    let mut contents = String::new();
    contents.push_str("this is line 1\n");
    contents.push_str("this is line 2\n");
    contents.push_str("this is line 3\n");
    // === write/replace file content ===
    fs::write(path, contents)
       .expect("Failed to write to file.");
    // === append content to file ===
    let path = path::Path::new("./fruits.txt");
    // new() function of the OpenOptions struct in the fs module
    let mut file = fs::OpenOptions::new()
        .append(true)
        .open(path)
        .expect("Failed to open file.");
    // uses the imported Write trait
    // expects an array of bytes as argument
    // notice the b in front of the string to convert to byte array
    file.write(b"\nolive\n")
        .expect("Failed to write to file.");
}
```

## Fruit finder

-   copy the fruits.txt file from previous sections in your project folder
-   we will create a program that looks for fruits in the list
-   if a fruit is in the list, it returns a message with its position in the list
-   if not found, it is added to the list

```rust
use std::env;
use std::fs;
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::path::Path;
fn main() {
    if env::args().len() != 3 {
        println!("This programs takes two arguments");
        std::process::exit(1);
    }
    let file_path = env::args().nth(1).expect("Failed to get file path");
    let search_name = env::args().nth(2).expect("Failed to get search name");
    let path = Path::new(&file_path);
    let fruits = fs::read_to_string(path).expect("Failed to read file");
    for (index, fruit) in fruits.lines().enumerate() {
        if fruit == search_name {
            println!(
                "{} is the {}{} fruit in the list",
                search_name,
                index + 1,
                if index == 0 {
                    "st"
                } else if index == 1 {
                    "nd"
                } else if index == 2 {
                    "rd"
                } else {
                    "th"
                }
            );
            return;
        }
    }
    println!("{} is not in the fruit list", search_name);
    let mut file = fs::OpenOptions::new()
        .append(true)
        .open(path)
        .expect("Failed to open file.");
    let mut new_fruit = search_name.clone();
    let fruits_bytes = fruits.as_bytes();
    if fruits_bytes[fruits_bytes.len() - 1] != b'\n' {
        // insert newline at start of the string new_fruit
        new_fruit.insert(0, '\n');
    }
    new_fruit.push('\n');
    file.write(new_fruit.as_bytes())
        .expect("Failed to write to file.");
    println!("{} was added to fruit list", search_name);
}
```

Output

```rust
> cat fruits.txt
apple
avocado
banana
cherry
orange
mango
coconut
pear
lemon
lime
pineapple
papaya
grape
guava
kiwi
elderberry
raspberry
tomato
> cargo run -q fruits.txt tomato
tomato is the 18th fruit in the list
> cargo run -q fruits.txt avocado
avocado is the 2nd fruit in the list
> cargo run -q fruits.txt peach
peach is not in the fruit list
peach was added to fruit list
cargo run -q fruits.txt peach
peach is the 19th fruit in the list
```

## Shape factories

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: f64,
    height: f64,
}
struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}
impl Rectangle {
    fn new(width: f64, height: f64) -> Rectangle {
        // notice the shorthand notation
        // when creating instance of struct
        // because method params have same names as struct fields
        Rectangle { width, height }
    }
    fn get_area(&self) -> f64 {
        self.height * self.width
    }
    fn scale(&mut self, scalar: f64) {
        self.width *= scalar;
        self.height *= scalar;
    }
}
impl Circle {
    fn new(radius: f64) -> Circle {
        Circle { radius }
    }
    fn get_area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius
    }
    fn get_diameter(&self) -> f64 {
        self.radius * 2.0
    }
}
fn main() {
    let mut rect = Rectangle::new(1.2, 3.4);
    assert_eq!(rect.get_area(), 4.08);
    rect.scale(0.5);
    assert_eq!(rect.get_area(), 1.02);
    let circ = Circle::new(4.0);
    assert_eq!(circ.get_diameter(), 8.0);
    let expected = 16.0 * std::f64::consts::PI;
    assert_eq!(circ.get_area(), expected);
    println!("Test passed!");
}
```

Output

```rust
Test passed!
```

## Generic struct definitions

```rust
// abstract stand-ins for concrete data types or other properties
// can be used with structs, functions, methods, etc. to help eliminate duplicate code
// gives flexibility to data types
// defined with <T> (T: generic type variable)
// the name of the generic variable is arbitrary, could be <Toto>
// similar to generics in TypeScrypt
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle<T> {
    width: T,
    height: T,
}
// multiple generic types
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Shape<T, U> {
    width: T,
    height: U,
}
fn main() {
    // creating rectangle with f64 data
    let rect = Rectangle {
        width: 1.2,
        height: 3.4,
    };
    println!("rect is {:?}", rect);
    // creating rectangle with u32 data
    let rect = Rectangle {
        width: 5,
        height: 11,
    };
    println!("rect is {:?}", rect);
    // creating rectangle with u8 data
    // notice we add u8 as a suffix to the number
    let rect = Rectangle {
        width: 7u8,
        height: 23u8,
    };
    println!("rect is {:?}", rect);
    // creating shape with u16 and f32 data
    let rect = Shape {
        width: 456u16,
        height: 78.54f32,
    };
    println!("rect is {:?}", rect);
}
```

Output

```rust
rect is Rectangle { width: 1.2, height: 3.4 }
rect is Rectangle { width: 5, height: 11 }
rect is Rectangle { width: 7, height: 23 }
rect is Shape { width: 456, height: 78.54 }
```

-   Generics are a zero cost abstraction = easier programming without slowing down runtime performance
-   The Rust compiler uses **monomorphization** for generics = replaces placeholders with concrete data types
-   At compile time, the code will include the concrete data types, **not** the generic abstraction = if you create a Rectangle with f64 data, the compiled code will have a struct definition for a Rectangle with f64 fields and as many concrete type definitions as the ones when creating struct instances.
-   The source code will use generic data types but the compiled code will have the concrete data types thus not impacting runtime performance (no guess work about data types).

## Generic method definitions

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle<T> {
    width: T,
    height: T,
}
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Shape<T, U> {
    width: T,
    height: U,
}
// include the generic variable names after the impl keyword
// and after the struct identifier
// impl<T, U> tells the compiler that methods for generic struct definition
impl<T, U> Shape<T, U> {
    fn get_width(&self) -> &T {
        // need to return a reference
        // because not know by which type <T> will be replaced with
        // remember ownership for fixed / mutable-length data type
        // returning a reference works for both without transfer of ownership
        &self.width
    }
}
// implementing methods for a specific concrete type of Shape
// notice not putting generic types after impl keyword tells the compiler that these methods are for concrete struct defintition
impl Shape<u8, u8> {
    fn get_perimeter(&self) -> u8 {
        (self.height + self.width) * 2
    }
}
fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle {
        width: 1.2,
        height: 3.4,
    };
    println!("rect is {:?}", rect);
    let rect = Rectangle {
        width: 5,
        height: 11,
    };
    println!("rect is {:?}", rect);
    let rect = Rectangle {
        width: 7u8,
        height: 23u8,
    };
    println!("rect is {:?}", rect);
    let rect = Shape {
        width: 456u16,
        height: 78.54f32,
    };
    println!("rect is {:?}", rect);
    println!("rect width is {:?}", rect.get_width());
    let rect = Shape {
        width: 54u8,
        height: 32u8,
    };
    // get_perimeter() method is defined on this instance of Shape
    // because the fields are both u8 data
    // otherwise this method would be not be found
    println!("rect perimter is {:?}", rect.get_perimeter());
}
```

Output

```rust
rect is Rectangle { width: 1.2, height: 3.4 }
rect is Rectangle { width: 5, height: 11 }
rect is Rectangle { width: 7, height: 23 }
rect is Shape { width: 456, height: 78.54 }
rect width is 456
rect perimter is 172
```

## Generic function definitions

```rust
// restrict the generic type
// to types that implement the Trait for values that can be compared for a sort-order (PartialOrd)
// PartialOrd trait is included in the std crate prelude (no need for full path)
// otherwise, how would the compiler know if the concrete types can be compared using > ?
fn get_biggest<T: PartialOrd>(n1: T, n2: T) -> T {
    if n1 > n2 {
        n1
    } else {
        n2
    }
}
fn main() {
    println!("biggest is {}", get_biggest(23u8, 121u8));
    println!("biggest is {}", get_biggest(12345, 121));
    println!("biggest is {}", get_biggest(123.45, 1.21));
}
```

Output

```rust
biggest is 121
biggest is 12345
biggest is 123.45
```

## Box data type

```rust
// Box<T> used to store data on the heap instead of the stack
// it consists of a pointer on the stack
// which points to a memory chunk on the heap
// that has been allocated large enough to hold <T> data
// Boxes are considered smart pointers
// provide more functionality than references:
// Box<T> has ownership of the data it points to
// Box<T> deallocates the heap memory when it goes out of scope
// Box data type is used to store a type whose size cannot be known at compile time
// but a size is still required
// ex: recursive types
// ex of recursive type: a struct which includes another struct of the same type as one of its fields (think about Iterators - like in JavaScript)
// you don't know the depth of layers at compile time and therefore not know the size of the overall structure
// another use case for boxes is to transfer ownership of data rather copying it on the stack
// to avoid copying large amounts of stack data
// potential performance improvement by moving data to heap where can be more easily transferred (because of pointers)
use std::mem;
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Team {
    name: String,
    size: u8,
    capacity: f64,
    domain: String,
}
fn main() {
    // remember the struct lives on the stack
    // except for mutable-length fields (ex: String) that leave on the heap
    let lions = Team {
        name: String::from("The lions"),
        size: 7,
        capacity: 11.5,
        domain: String::from("Authentication"),
    };
    println!("lions is {:?}", lions);
    // mem::size_of_val() gives the size in byte of what the given reference points to
    println!(
      "lions size is on stack {} bytes",
      mem::size_of_val(&lions)
    );
    // this is not a copy operation, ownership is moved
    // the lions variable looses ownership of the struct
    // the lions variable can no longer be used
    // the struct instance is transferred to to heap location allocated by the box
    // the boxed_lions variable becomes the new owner of the struct
    // through the box smart pointer that lives on the stack
    let boxed_lions: Box<Team> = Box::new(lions);
    println!("boxed_lions is {:?}", boxed_lions);
    // printing size in bytes of the box pointer
    println!(
        "boxed_lions size is on stack {} bytes",
        mem::size_of_val(&boxed_lions)
    );
    // printing size in byte of the struct instance
    // need to pass a reference to the dereferenced box pointer (WTF...) to mem::size_of_val()
    // using the dereference operator "*" before the box pointer
    // referencing a pointer will represent the pointed-to location / data:
    // &*boxed_lions is a reference to the data on the heap rather than the pointer on the stack
    println!(
        "boxed_lions team size is on heap {} bytes",
        mem::size_of_val(&*boxed_lions)
    );
    // moving back the struct instance on the stack
    // by dereferencing the box pointer
    let unboxed_lions: Team = *boxed_lions;
    println!("unboxed_lions is {:?}", unboxed_lions);
    println!(
        "unboxed_lions team size is on stack {} bytes",
        mem::size_of_val(&unboxed_lions)
    );
}
```

Output

```rust
lions is Team { name: "The lions", size: 7, capacity: 11.5, domain: "Authentication" }
lions size is on stack 64 bytes
boxed_lions is Team { name: "The lions", size: 7, capacity: 11.5, domain: "Authentication" }
boxed_lions size is on stack 8 bytes
boxed_lions team size is on heap 64 bytes
unboxed_lions is Team { name: "The lions", size: 7, capacity: 11.5, domain: "Authentication" }
unboxed_lions team size is on stack 64 bytes
```

## Summing boxes

```rust
use std::ops::Add;
// restrict generic type T to concrete types that implement the Add trait (like u32, f64, etc.)
fn sum_boxes<T: Add<Output = T>>(b1: Box<T>, b2: Box<T>) -> Box<T> {
    let unboxed_b1 = *b1;
    let unboxed_b2 = *b2;
    let sum = unboxed_b1 + unboxed_b2;
    Box::new(sum)
}
fn main() {
    let box1 = Box::new(11);
    let box2 = Box::new(44);
    let sum_box = sum_boxes(box1, box2);
    assert_eq!(*sum_box, 55);
    let box1 = Box::new(1.1);
    let box2 = Box::new(4.4);
    let sum_box = sum_boxes(box1, box2);
    assert_eq!(*sum_box, 5.5);
    let box1 = Box::new(1.1f32);
    let box2 = Box::new(4.4f32);
    let sum_box = sum_boxes(box1, box2);
    assert_eq!(*sum_box, 5.5f32);
    let box1 = Box::new(11u8);
    let box2 = Box::new(44u8);
    let sum_box = sum_boxes(box1, box2);
    assert_eq!(*sum_box, 55u8);
    let box1 = Box::new(11u16);
    let box2 = Box::new(44u16);
    let sum_box = sum_boxes(box1, box2);
    assert_eq!(*sum_box, 55u16);
    println!("tests passed!");
}
```

Output

```rust
test passed!
```

Compact version

```rust
use std::ops::Add;
fn sum_boxes<T: Add<Output = T>>(b1: Box<T>, b2: Box<T>) -> Box<T> {
    Box::new(*b1 + *b2)
}
fn main() {
    assert_eq!(*sum_boxes(Box::new(11), Box::new(44)), 55);
    assert_eq!(*sum_boxes(Box::new(1.1), Box::new(4.4)), 5.5);
    assert_eq!(*sum_boxes(Box::new(1.1f32), Box::new(4.4f32)), 5.5f32);
    assert_eq!(*sum_boxes(Box::new(11u8), Box::new(44u8)), 55u8);
    assert_eq!(*sum_boxes(Box::new(11u16), Box::new(44u16)), 55u16);
    println!("tests passed!");
}
```

More complex generic type restriction

```rust
use std::ops::{Add, MulAssign};
// remove the Copy trait restriction and see what happens
// more on this later
fn sum_boxes<T: Add<Output = T> + MulAssign + Copy>(
    mut b1: Box<T>,
    b2: Box<T>
) -> Box<T> {
    *b1 *= *b2;
    Box::new(*b1 + *b2)
}
fn main() {
    let box1 = Box::new(11);
    let box2 = Box::new(44);
    assert_eq!(*sum_boxes(box1, box2), 528);
    let box1 = Box::new(1.1);
    let box2 = Box::new(4.4);
    assert_eq!(*sum_boxes(box1, box2), 9.240000000000002);
    let box1 = Box::new(1.1f32);
    let box2 = Box::new(4.4f32);
    assert_eq!(*sum_boxes(box1, box2), 9.24f32);
    let box1 = Box::new(11u16);
    let box2 = Box::new(44u16);
    assert_eq!(*sum_boxes(box1, box2), 528u16);
    println!("tests passed!");
}
```

## Traits

```rust
// trait;
// abstract way to define capabilities for functionality of specific data types
// collection of methods
// representing a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some task
// data types can implement a trait:
// the type implements those specific methods so they'll be available for use with it
// generics use traits to specify the capabilities of unknown data types:
// the trait act as a bound for which concrete types will be accepted
// as long as these concrete types implement the set of methods
// similar to interfaces in TypeScript and other languages supporting classical OOP
// Rust comes with default common traits (see the std::prelude)
// you can define your custom traits
struct Car {
    model: String,
    brand: String,
    velocity: u16, // km/h
}
struct Plane {
    name: String,
    nick_name: String,
    velocity: u16, // km/h
    crew: u8,
    passengers: u16,
    ceiling: u32,
}
// custom trait
trait Serialization {
    // method signatures
    fn describe(&self) -> String;
}
// implementing trait for a specific type
impl Serialization for Car {
    fn describe(&self) -> String {
        // format! macro returns formatted string
        format!(
            "{} from {} going at {} km/h.",
            self.model, self.brand, self.velocity
        )
    }
}
// implementing trait for another type
impl Serialization for Plane {
    fn describe(&self) -> String {
        format!(
            "{} ({}) going at {} km/h with a crew of {} and up to {} passengers at {} m above.",
            self.name, self.nick_name, self.velocity, self.crew, self.passengers, self.ceiling
        )
    }
}
fn main() {
    let gle_class_coupe = Car {
        model: String::from("GLE-Class Coupe"),
        brand: String::from("Mercedes-Benz"),
        velocity: 280,
    };
    let g6 = Plane {
        name: String::from("Gulfstream G650 "),
        nick_name: String::from("G6"),
        velocity: 956,
        crew: 4,
        passengers: 19,
        ceiling: 15545,
    };
    println!("{}", gle_class_coupe.describe());
    println!("{}", g6.describe());
}
```

Output

```rust
GLE-Class Coupe from Mercedes-Benz going at 280 km/h.
Gulfstream G650  (G6) going at 956 km/h with a crew of 4 and up to 19 passengers at 15545 m above.
```

## Default trait implementation

```rust
struct Car {
    model: String,
    brand: String,
    velocity: u16, // km/h
}
struct Plane {
    name: String,
    nick_name: String,
    velocity: u16, // km/h
    crew: u8,
    passengers: u16,
    ceiling: u32,
}
trait Serialization {
    // default trait implementation
    // to avoid having to implement it for each type that uses the trait
    fn describe(&self) -> String {
        String::from("some kind of vehicle.")
    }
}
impl Serialization for Car {
    // specific trait implementation for Car structure
    // overriding the default implementation
    fn describe(&self) -> String {
        format!(
            "{} from {} going at {} km/h.",
            self.model, self.brand, self.velocity
        )
    }
}
// will use the default trait implementation because no specific one
impl Serialization for Plane {}
fn main() {
    let gle_class_coupe = Car {
        model: String::from("GLE-Class Coupe"),
        brand: String::from("Mercedes-Benz"),
        velocity: 280,
    };
    let g6 = Plane {
        name: String::from("Gulfstream G650 "),
        nick_name: String::from("G6"),
        velocity: 956,
        crew: 4,
        passengers: 19,
        ceiling: 15545,
    };
    println!("{}", gle_class_coupe.describe());
    println!("{}", g6.describe());
}
```

Output

```rust
GLE-Class Coupe from Mercedes-Benz going at 280 km/h.
some kind of vehicle.
```

## Derivable traits

```rust
// by default new structs do not implement any trait
// you as the programmer give it the traits it needs
// derivable traits provide default implementations for common traits
// gives access to basic functionalities
// instead of having to implement custom traits
// when deriving traits,
// the compiler generates default code for the required methods
// derivable traits are (subject to change as the language evolves):
// Eq
// PartialEq
// Ord
// PartialOrd
// Clone
// Copy
// Hash
// Default - create empty instance of a data type
// Debug - provide formatted debug string
// to derive traits:  #[ derive( trait_a, trait_b, ..) ]
// default implementation of PartialEq requires all fields of both structs to be equal to return true
// (check documentation  std::cmp::PartialEq)
// default implementation of PartialOrd compares the values of the fields,
// parses the fields in order of definition and
// once found a field that can be compared,
// will return result of comparison
// and not look at other fields (check documentation  std::cmp::PartialOrd)
#[derive(PartialEq, PartialOrd, Debug)]
struct Car {
    model: String,
    brand: String,
    velocity: u16, // km/h
}
fn main() {
    let gle_class_coupe = Car {
        model: String::from("GLE-Class Coupe"),
        brand: String::from("Mercedes-Benz"),
        velocity: 280,
    };
    let gle_class = Car {
        model: String::from("GLE-Class"),
        brand: String::from("Mercedes-Benz"),
        velocity: 218,
    };
    // allowed because of derived PartialEq trait
    println!("Are the cars equal: {}", gle_class_coupe == gle_class);
    // allowed because of derived PartialOrd trait
    // here the name field is compared to assert which one is greater
    println!(
        "Is the coupe greater then the SUV: {}",
        gle_class_coupe > gle_class
    );
    // allowed because of derived Debug trait
    println!("{:?}", gle_class);
}
```

Output

```rust
Are the cars equal: false
Is the coupe greater then the SUV: true
Car { model: "GLE-Class", brand: "Mercedes-Benz", velocity: 218 }Are the cars equal: falseIs the coupe greater then the SUV: trueCar { model: "GLE-Class", brand: "Mercedes-Benz", velocity: 218 }
```

## Trait bounds

```rust
// when working with generics we can use traits
// in order to stipulate which functionalities the concrete types must implement
// trait bounds force a generic type to implement specific traits
// trait bounds guarantee a generic type will have the necessary behaviors
use std::fmt::Debug;
use std::any;
// To be able to print an item it must implement the Display trait
// but because not all type implement it, we will use the Debug trait
// which is more commonly implemented by default
fn print_type<T: Debug>(it: T) {
    // type_name() returns the name of a type as a string slice
    // by passing the type to the turbofish operator (::<MY_TYPE>)
    println!("{:?} is a {}", it, any::type_name::<T>());
}
fn main() {
    print_type(1);
    print_type(1.2);
    print_type([12, 34]);
}
```

Output

```rust
1 is a i32
1.2 is a f64
[12, 34] is a [i32; 2]
```

## Multiple trait bounds and where clause

```rust
use std::fmt::Display;
// multiple trait bounds are separated by a + operator
// PartialEq/From/Copy are part of the prelude of the std library so no import
// fn compare_and_print<T: Display + PartialEq + From<U>, U: Display + PartialEq + Copy>(a: T, b: U) {
// the below function signature is equivalent to the above
// but more readable with the were clause to declare trait bounds
fn compare_and_print<T, U>(a: T, b: U)
where
    T: Display + PartialEq + From<U>,
    U: Display + PartialEq + Copy,
{
    // T::from(b) => convert b to type T
    // From trait allows for a type
    // to define how to create itself from another type.
    // ex: creating a string from string slice
    //      String::from("ttoto")
    if a == T::from(b) {
        println!("{} is equal to {}", a, b);
    } else {
        println!("{} is not equal to {}", a, b);
    }
}
fn main() {
    compare_and_print(22, 55);
    compare_and_print(2.2, 2.2);
}
```

Output

```rust
22 is not equal to 55
2.2 is equal to 2.2
```

## Return types and implemented traits

```rust
use std::fmt::Display;
// the return value must implement the Display trait
fn get_displayable() -> impl Display {
    1
}
fn main() {
    println!("Display: {}", get_displayable());
}
```

Output

```rust
Display: 1
```

## Return types and dynamic dispatching with traits

```rust
use std::fmt::Display;
// dynamic dispatch
// when the retun type cannot be known until runtime
// notice the dyn keyword and the use of a Box pointers
// Returns a value that implements the Display trait,
// but we do not know which one at compile time.
fn get_dynamic_displayable(a: bool) -> Box<dyn Display> {
    if a {
        // returns u32
        Box::new(1)
    } else {
        // returns string slice
        Box::new("one")
    }
}
fn main() {
    println!("Display: {}", get_dynamic_displayable(false));
}
```

Output

```rust
Display: one
```

## Comparing jet planes

```rust
use std::cmp::*;
use std::fmt;
struct Jet {
    name: String,
    velocity: f64, // km/h
}
// custom implementation of the Display trait
impl fmt::Display for Jet {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "{}, flying at {} km/h", self.name, self.velocity)
    }
}
// custom implementation of the PartialOrd trait
impl PartialOrd for Jet {
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {
        self.velocity.partial_cmp(&other.velocity)
    }
}
// custom implementation of the PartialEq trait
impl PartialEq for Jet {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
        self.velocity == other.velocity
    }
}
fn main() {
    let g6 = Jet {
        name: String::from("Gulfstream G650"),
        velocity: 956.0,
    };
    let g7 = Jet {
        name: String::from("Gulfstream G700"),
        velocity: 937.0,
    };
    println!("G6 jet is {}", g6);
    println!("Does G6 velocity equal to G7's: {}", g6.eq(&g7));
    println!("Is G6 faster than G7: {}", g6.gt(&g7));
}
```

Output

```rust
G6 jet is Gulfstream G650, flying at 956 km/h
Does G6 velocity equal to G7's: false
Is G6 faster than G7: true
```

## Borrow checker

```rust
// borrow checker
// compares scopes to determine whether all borrows are valid
// lifetime (how long it is alive) of variables annotated like " 'a "
// the lifetime of a variable is related to its scope
// Rust analyses the scope / lifetime of the values referenced by a variable
// using the borrow checker
fn main() {
    let fuel; // ========= START lifetime ('a) of fuel ==========
    {
        let gasoil = String::from("gasoil"); // ===== START lifetime ('b) of gasoil =======
        fuel = &gasoil;
        println!("fuel is {}", fuel);
    } // ========= END lifetime of gasoil ================
} // ========= END lifetime of fuel ================
```

Error detected by the borrow checker:

```rust
fn main() {
    let fuel; // ========= START 'a ================
    {

        let gasoil = String::from("gasoil"); // ===== START 'b =====
        fuel = &gasoil;
    } // ========= END 'b ================

    // fuel stores a borrowed reference to gasoil
    // gasoil lifetime is done
    // fuel contains a dangling reference, the program will not compile
    println!("fuel is {}", fuel);
} // ========= END 'a ================
```

Fixing the lifetime error by extending the lifetime of gasoil:

```rust
fn main() {
    let fuel; // ========= START 'a ================
    let gasoil = String::from("gasoil"); // ======= START 'b ========
    {
        fuel = &gasoil;
    }

    println!("fuel is {}", fuel);
} // ========= END 'a and 'b ================
```

Output

```rust
fuel is gasoil
```

## Lifetime annotation

```rust
// defining a generic lifetime 'a
// explicitly defining a generic lifetime for parameters
// is called lifetime annotation
// must begin with apostrophe ('x)
// convention is to use a single lowercase letter ('a, 'b, 'c)
// but you are free to name it whatever ('a_lifetime, 'toto)
// pay attention to the lifetime annotation
// which follows the borrow operator followed by a space then the type
// in this example, by annotating the return type,
// we tell the compiler that the returned value has the same lifetime as the params
// in case there are different lifetimes,
// the compiler will take the smallest
// by annotating the lifetime of the parameters,
// we give the borrow checker the info to validate the returned reference
fn get_longest_name<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
fn main() {
    let result;
    let name1 = String::from("Deep Space 9");
    let name2 = String::from("Voyager");
    result = get_longest_name(&name1, &name2);
    println!("result is {}", result);
}
```

Output

```rust
result is Deep Space 9
```

## Multiple lifetime annotations

```rust
// notice here that although the return type has the same lifetime as one param
// we must annotate the other param with another lifetime
// even if never returned
// to avoid any confusion
// remember that here the code is simple
// but the input and the returned value could coming from a compiled library
// that the compiler does not have access to the source code
fn get_longest_name<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        x
    }
}
fn main() {
    let result;
    // START 'a
    let name1 = String::from("Deep Space 9");
    {
        // START 'b
        let name2 = String::from("Voyager");
        result = get_longest_name(&name1, &name2);
    } // END 'b
println!("result is {}", result);
} // END 'a
```

Output

```rust
result is Deep Space 9
```

## Lifetime elision rules

```rust
// lifetime elision rules
// set of rules for the compiler to analyze reference lifetimes
// describes situations that do not require explicit lifetime annotations
// if any ambiguity remains, explicit lifetime annotation will be required
// currently, 3 lifetime elision rules:
// #1
// each input parameter that is a reference is assigned its own lifetime
// fn get_first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &str {
// lifetimes only apply for parameters that are references,
// non-reference parameters don't need them
// fn get_first_word<'a>(s: &'a str, t: i32) -> &str {
// fn get_first_word<'a, 'b>(s: &'a str, t: &'b str) -> &str {
// fn get_first_word<'a, 'b, 'c>(s: &'a str, t: &'b str, u: &'c str) -> &str {
// #2
// if there's only one input lifetime,
// assign it to all output lifetimes
// (the output lifetime must necessarily match one of the input lifetime)
// qualifies for elision thus lifetimes can be omitted:
// fn get_first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
// ==> fn get_first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
// #3
// if there's a &self or &mut self input parameter,
// its lifetime will be assigned to all output lifetimes
// fn do_stuff(&self, input: &str) -> &str {
// rule #1 ==> fn do_stuff<'a,'b>(&'a self, input: &'b str) -> &str {
// rule #3 ==> fn do_stuff<'a,'b>(&'a self, input: &'b str) -> &'a str {
// these elision rules are for the compiler
// but it's good to know when you can omit lifetimes
fn main() {
    let message = String::from("Hi there");
    let first_word = get_first_word(&message);
    println!("first_word is {}", first_word);
}
fn get_first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    for (index, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[..index]; // found blank space
        }
    }
    &s // no blank space found, input is a single word
}
```

Output

```rust
first_word is Hi
```

## Struct lifetime annotations

```rust
struct Spaceship<'a> {
    // the struct has ownership of that string
    // when the struct goes out of scope,
    // that string data will be dropped and removed from the heap
    name: String,
    // the struct does not own the data referenced by this field
    // there is ambiguity if the struct can still use that reference
    // need to add explicit lifetime annotation
    nickname: &'a str,
}
// Annotate lifetimes to impl.
impl<'a, 'b> Spaceship<'a> {
    // because of lifetime elision rule #3,
    // no need for explicit lifetime annotation
    // the output lifetimes will have the lifetime as the &self parameter
    fn send_transmission(&self, msg: &str) -> (&str, &str) {
        println!("Transmitting message: {}", msg);
        (&self.name, self.nickname)
    }
    // here, because the output lifetime is different from the &self input lifetime,
    // need for explicit lifetime annotation
    fn test_send_transmission(&'a self, msg: &'b str) -> &'b str {
        println!("Transmitting message: {}", msg);
        msg
    }
}
fn main() {
    let saucer = Spaceship {
        name: String::from("TR95 MCC Enterprise 9"),
        nickname: "TR95",
    };
    let sender = saucer.send_transmission("All aboard!");
    println!("sender is {}", sender.1);
    let test_msg = saucer.test_send_transmission("this is a test");
    println!("test_msg is {}", test_msg);
}
```

Output

```rust
Transmitting message: All aboard!
sender is TR95
Transmitting message: this is a test
test_msg is this is a test
```

## Static lifetimes

```rust
// 'static lifetime
// indicates references available for the entire duration of the program
// example: a string literal is stored in the program binary
// so it never goes away
// the data is available from start to finish
// all string literals have a static lifetime:
//  let literal: &'static str = "I am a string slice";
// will never become invalid and lives longer than other lifetimes
// 'static lifetime as a trait bound
// ensures the data type will only contain 'static elements
// so that the receiver can hold onto it
// and use it as long as they want knowing it will never become invalid:
// <T: Display + 'static>
fn get_toto<'a>() -> &'a str {
    "toto here"
}
fn main() {
  let toto: &'static str = get_toto();
  println!("toto is {}", toto);
}
```

Output

```rust
toto is toto here
```

## More on enums

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Shape {
    // storing data in enum variants by declaring parameter types
    Triangle(f64, f64, f64), // sides a, b, c
    Rectangle(f64, f64),     // width, height
    Circle(f64),             // radius
}
fn main() {
    let a_shape = Shape::Triangle(1.1, 2.2, 3.3);
    println!("a_shape is {:?}", a_shape);
    let a_shape = Shape::Rectangle(1.3, 5.7);
    println!("a_shape is {:?}", a_shape);
    let a_shape = Shape::Circle(1.13);
    println!("a_shape is {:?}", a_shape);
    // match operator
    // compares a value to a series of patterns
    // to determine which code to execute
    // similar to switch statements in other languages
    // match expression used to control flow of program
    match a_shape {
        // enumerate all possible values
        // capture the stored data
        // using a positional parameter name (a, b, c)
        // the logic to execute, when a match, is after the " => "
        Shape::Triangle(a, b, c) => println!(
            "a_shape is a triangle with sides a = {}, b = {}, c = {}",
            a, b, c
        ),
        Shape::Rectangle(width, height) => println!(
            "a_shape is a rectangle with width = {} and height = {}",
            width, height
        ),
        Shape::Circle(radius) => println!("a_shape is a circle with radius {}", radius),
    }
}
```

Output

```rust
a_shape is Triangle(1.1, 2.2, 3.3)
a_shape is Rectangle(1.3, 5.7)
a_shape is Circle(1.13)
a_shape is a circle with radius 1.13
```

## Match with wildcard pattern

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 123u8;
    // match expression returning values based on case
    // match arms are evaluated sequentially from top to bottom
   let result: &str = match number {
        // match arm
        0 => "zero",
        // match arm
        1 => "one",
        // match arm
        2 => "two",
        // wildcard pattern (default case)
        // represented by an underscore symbol (_)
        // should be used last,
        // otherwise the following arms will not be evaluated.
        // useful when you don't want to define all possible match arms explicitly
        // (or simply because there is a high or infinite number of possibilities)
        // notice the code block when more than one line
        _ => {
            println!("{} did not match any arm", number);
            "unmatched"
        }
    };
    println!("result is {}", result);
}
```

Output

```rust
123 did not match any arm
result is unmatched
```

## Enum methods

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Shape {
    Triangle(f64, f64, f64), // sides a, b, c
    Rectangle(f64, f64),     // width, height
    Circle(f64),             // radius
}
impl Shape {
    fn get_perimeter(&self) -> f64 {
        // no need to dereference the self variable
        // the compiler will automatically reference/dereference patterns in match expressions
        // match *self {
        match self {
            Shape::Rectangle(width, height) => (width + height) * 2.0,
            Shape::Triangle(a, b, c) => a + b + c,
            Shape::Circle(radius) => radius * 2.0 * std::f64::consts::PI,
        }
    }
}
fn main() {
    let a_shape = Shape::Triangle(1.1, 2.2, 3.3);
    println!("a_shape is {:?}", a_shape);
    println!("a_shape perimeter is {}", a_shape.get_perimeter());
    let a_shape = Shape::Rectangle(1.3, 5.7);
    println!("a_shape is {:?}", a_shape);
    println!("a_shape perimeter is {}", a_shape.get_perimeter());
    let a_shape = Shape::Circle(1.13);
    println!("a_shape is {:?}", a_shape);
    println!("a_shape perimeter is {:.2}", a_shape.get_perimeter());
}
```

Output

```rust
a_shape is Triangle(1.1, 2.2, 3.3)
a_shape perimeter is 6.6
a_shape is Rectangle(1.3, 5.7)
a_shape perimeter is 14
a_shape is Circle(1.13)
a_shape perimeter is 7.10
```

## Option\<T\> enum

```rust
// in many languages,
//  errors occur when using a null value in a not-null context
// Rust does not have a traditional null value
// instead Rust uses a generic enum named Option
// which can be of two variants:
// enum Option<T> {
//   Some(T),
//   None
// }
// 1) Some: indicates that has a value
// 2) None : indicates that no value
// the Option enum is included in the prelude
fn main() {
    // instantiate an option enum
    let someone: Option<i32> = Some(1);
    println!("someone is {:?}", someone);
    let something: Option<&str> = Some("thing");
    println!("something is {:?}", something);
    let nothing: Option<i32> = None;
    println!("nothing is {:?}", nothing);
    let countdown = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];
    // use get() on slices to get an option enum holding
    // a reference to the value at the specified index
    let item = countdown.get(5);
    println!("item is {:?}", item);
    let item = countdown.get(0);
    println!("item is {:?}", item);
    let item = countdown.get(2);
    let item = item.unwrap_or(&0) + 1;
    println!("item is {:?}", item);
    let item = countdown.get(20);
    // unwrap_or(&default_value):
    // if variant is Option::Some returns the stored data
    // if the variant is Option::None, the passed argument is used instead
    // notice that the argument is a reference
    let item = item.unwrap_or(&0) + 1;
    println!("item is {:?}", item);
}
```

Output

```rust
someone is Some(1)
something is Some("thing")
nothing is None
item is None
item is Some(5)
item is 4
item is 1
```

## Matching Option\<T\>

```rust
fn main() {
    let countdown = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];
    let item = countdown.get(5);
    println!("item is {:?}", item);
    let item = countdown.get(0);
    println!("item is {:?}", item);
    let item = countdown.get(3);
    // using match expression to return value
    let item = match item {
        Some(value) => value + 1,
        None => 0,
    };
    println!("item is {:?}", item);
    let item = countdown.get(20);
    let item = match item {
        Some(value) => value + 1,
        None => 0,
    };
    println!("item is {:?}", item);
}
```

Output

```rust
item is None
item is Some(5)
item is 3
item is 0
```

## If-let matching

```rust
// if let syntax
// use when matching only one variant
fn main() {
    let number = Some(1);
    // notice the syntax:
    // if let PATTERN = VALUE {}
    if let Some(1) = number {
        println!("You are the one");
    }
}
```

Output

```rust
You are the one
```

## Location enum

```rust
use std::fmt;
enum Location {
    Unknown,
    Anonymous,
    Known(f64, f64), // latitude, longitude
}
impl fmt::Display for Location {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
        match self {
            Location::Anonymous => write!(f, "Location is anonymous"),
            Location::Unknown => write!(f, "Location is unknown"),
            Location::Known(latitude, longitude) => {
                write!(f, "latitude: {} longitude: {}", latitude, longitude)
            }
        }
    }
}
fn main() {
    let address = Location::Anonymous;
    println!("address is {}", address);
    let address = Location::Unknown;
    println!("address is {}", address);
    let address = Location::Known(123.4, 456.7);
    println!("address is {}", address);
}
```

Output

```rust
address is Location is anonymous
address is Location is unknown
address is latitude: 123.4 longitude: 456.7
```

## Unrecoverable errors

```rust
// two types of runtime errors in Rust
// Recoverable (ex: file not found error)
// Unrecoverable (ex: index out of array bounds)
// most languages do not distinguish between these errors
// and use Exceptions to handle all of them
// Rust does not have traditional Exceptions:
// Rust uses the Result<T, E> enum type for recoverable errors
// Rust uses panics for unrecoverable errors
fn main() {
    // panic! macro
    // immediately terminates the program
    // and provides feedback to caller of program
    // panic!("Something went wrong.");
    let countdown: [i32; 4] = [3, 2, 1, 0];
    for left in countdown.iter() {
        println!("T-minus {}", left);
        // the program will panic when diving by zero
        let q = 1 / left;
        println!("q is {}", q);
    }
}
```

Output

```rust
T-minus 3
q is 0
T-minus 2
q is 0
T-minus 1
q is 1
T-minus 0
thread 'main' panicked at 'attempt to divide by zero', /home/<USER>/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/core/src/ops/arith.rs:474:1
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

## Recoverable errors

```rust
// recoverable errors
// errors that do not cause the program to fail
// and can be corrected
// Rust uses the Result<T,E> enum type to handle recoverable errors
// enum Result<T, E> {
//     Ok(T),
//     Err(E),
// }
// the Ok variant stores the value of the successful operation
// the Err variant stores the value of the error
// the Result enum is included in the prelude
use std::fs;
use std::io;
fn main() {
    // read_to_string() returns a Result<T, E> enum
    // create a file named file.txt in the root of the project folder:
    // $ echo 42 > file.txt
    let content: Result<String, io::Error> = fs::read_to_string("file.txt");
    // avoid the unwrap() method
    // because will panic if this is the Err variant of the Result enum
    println!("content is {:?}", content.unwrap());
    // for custom error message, use expect()
    // not the best way to handle recoverable errors
    let content: Result<String, io::Error> = fs::read_to_string("file-x.txt");
    println!("content is {:?}", content.expect("failed reading file"));
}
```

Output

```rust
content is "42\n"
thread 'main' panicked at 'failed reading file: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }', src/main.rs:35:41
```

## Matching Result\<T, E\> enum for error handling

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;
fn main() {
    let result = fs::read_to_string("does-not-exist.txt");
    let content = match result {
        Ok(text) => text,
        // handle I/O error based on kind
        Err(error) => match error.kind() {
            io::ErrorKind::NotFound => String::from("File not found"),
            io::ErrorKind::PermissionDenied => {
              String::from("Permission denied")
            },
            _ => error.to_string(),
        },
    };
    println!("content is \"{}\"", content);
}
```

Output

```rust
content is "File not found"
```

## Propagating errors

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;
fn read_and_combine(f1: &str, f2: &str) -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut s1 = match fs::read_to_string(f1) {
        Ok(s) => s,
        // propagating the error to caller
        Err(e) => return Err(e),
    };
    // Rust provides a shorthand syntax for propagating errors
    // by removing the match expression
    // and putting a question mark (?) after the Result enum
    // it is equivalent to the above syntax
    // the ? can only be used with functions that return a Result enum
    let s2 = fs::read_to_string(f2)?;
    s1.push('\n');
    s1.push_str(&s2);
    Ok(s1)
}
fn main() {
    match read_and_combine("file1.txt", "file2.txt") {
        Ok(text_result) => println!("result is:\n{}", text_result),
        Err(e) => println!("Got error: {}", e),
    };
}
```

Output

```rust
Got error: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

## Guessing game revisited with error handling

```rust
use rand::prelude::*;
use std::io;
fn main() {
    guess_with_infinite_retry();
}
fn guess_with_infinite_retry() {
    let secret_number = thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
    let mut invalid_numberretry_limit = 0;
    println!("Guess a number between 1 and 100:");
    loop {
        let mut buffer = String::new();
        let guess = match io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer) {
            Ok(_) => match buffer.trim().parse::<u32>() {
                Ok(number) => number,
                Err(e) => {
                    invalid_numberretry_limit += 1;
                    if invalid_numberretry_limit == 3 {
                        panic!("Too many invalid numbers entered");
                    }
                    println!("Failed to parse guess: {}", e);
                    println!("Please enter a valid number:");
                    continue;
                }
            },
            Err(e) => {
                println!("Failed to read line: {}", e);
                continue;
            }
        };
        if guess < secret_number {
            println!("guess too low, guess higher:");
        } else if guess > secret_number {
            println!("guess too high, guess lower:");
        } else {
            println!("you found it!");
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

Output

```rust
Guess a number between 1 and 100:
Failed to parse guess: cannot parse integer from empty string
Please enter a valid number:
Failed to parse guess: cannot parse integer from empty string
Please enter a valid number:
thread 'main' panicked at 'Too many invalid numbers entered', src/main.rs:19:25
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

Or

```rust
Guess a number between 1 and 100:
44
guess too low, guess higher:
77
guess too low, guess higher:
99
guess too high, guess lower:
88
guess too high, guess lower:
80
you found it!
```

## Vectors with error handling

```rust
fn main() {
    // create an empty vector
    let mut presidents: Vec<String> = Vec::new();
    presidents.push(String::from("Chirac"));
    presidents.push(String::from("Sarkozy"));
    presidents.push(String::from("Hollande"));
    presidents.push(String::from("Macron"));
    println!("presidents are {:?}", presidents);
    let last = match presidents.pop() {
        Some(president) => president,
        None => "not found".to_string(),
    };
    println!("last is {}", last);
    let fourth = match presidents.get(3) {
        Some(president) => president,
        None => "not found",
    };
    println!("fourth president is {}", fourth);
    // creating a vector with the vec![] macro
    let countdown = vec![4, 3, 2, 1];
    println!("countdown is {:?}", countdown);
}
```

Output

```rust
presidents are ["Chirac", "Sarkozy", "Hollande", "Macron"]
last is Macron
fourth president is not found
countdown is [4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## HashMap\<K, V\> data type

```rust
// stores data in key / value pairs
// use the keys to lookup corresponding values
// key -> value mapping is one way
// Rust uses a hash function to determine how to store data
// keys and values can be different data types
// all keys must have the same type
// all values must have the same type
// each key can only have one value associated with it at a time
// you need to import the type
// updating hashmap entries, approaches:
// #1: overwrite existing key/value pair
// #2: insert a new entry if a key does not exist
// #3: modify a value based on its existing value
use std::collections::HashMap;
fn main() {
    let mut missions = HashMap::new();
    missions.insert("Toto", 23); // HashMap<&str, i32>
    missions.insert("Toto", 33); // #1 update
    missions.insert("Titi", 45);
    missions.insert("Tata", 67);
    missions.entry("Tutu").or_insert(77); // #2 update
    // #3 update
    let tyty = missions.entry("Titi").or_insert(0);
    *tyty += 1;
    println!("missions is {:?}", missions.clone());
    let toto_missions = match missions.get("Toto") {
        Some(value) => value,
        None => &0,
    };
    println!("Toto_missions is {}", toto_missions);
}
```

Output

```rust
missions is {"Tata": 67, "Titi": 46, "Toto": 33, "Tutu": 77}
Toto_missions is 33
```

## Word counter

Create a file named “lorem.txt” with the following content:
