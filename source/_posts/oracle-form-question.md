### setting item property to <Unspecified>

Help me how to set item propert to <Unspecified> value. For example, i have radio button with Background color sets to 'gray' and i want set it to <Unspecified> to get transparency effect and i can't do this. If i set property value to blank forms builder shout "color by this name does not exist".  

Answser: Go to the item in question and press the 'Inherit' button in the 'Property Palette'.
